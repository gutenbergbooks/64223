  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>AN INTRODUCTION TO LUCIFRAM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the little planet Lucifram, that spun a brilliant
and solitary course among the stars, exchanging
annual salutations with them as the waxing and
waning of the solar laws brought them out of the
void and within hail, the people each and all walked
upside down. The trees were upside down, the
houses, the churches with their steeples, the palaces,
the oceans, rivers, lakes, mountains, animals, and
fishes, each and all, reversed our own conception
of mundane propriety. Cultivate a patience with
the seeming strangeness of this extraordinary planet,
even to the reading of this simple book, and let that
virtue lead you nearer to another sphere, more to
your liking.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were a few, indeed, upon this sphere who
did their best to stand upon their feet. Sometimes
they succeeded; but others were bowled down in
the struggle and ended by standing once again upon
their heads, or lying crushed, paying the debt they
owed to Outraged Custom.</p>

<p class='c004'>The circumference of this sphere was something
like two thousand miles. It bulged out towards the
north and south, with giant hollows to the east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and west. And because <em>everything</em> that existed was
contrary to our idea of things, all things looked
normal.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Nature and architecture combine to alter
things, making them contrariwise, as people call it,
what wonder if morality and all ethics blend with
the custom?</p>

<p class='c004'>To begin with governments and kingships. Unlike
those upon a two-legged basis, a king was never
chosen for his worth, but for his frailties. He was
chosen to strew the path of his subjects with flowers
which all might pick like little children out at play,
and then would quarrel over.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alas! To be a king in the planet Lucifram! That
little planet topsy-turvy. Here, though a ruler
might have the will of a Hercules to turn a somersalt
and land upon his feet, some diviner instinct
calling him to that, the pigmies around him pinned
him with millions of tiny threads, an anchorage
whereby to hold his head safe to the ground.
Threads worked in gold! Held for the wonder of
the multitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>So for the kings. The Gods of all the stars
looked down on them. They heard those faint
sighs of weakness—those breathings after higher
things—and pitied some, and smiled at others.
And though in the topsy-turvy synagogues and
churches the people prayed for them, no prayers
reached heaven except those simple few the kings
themselves breathed in solitude. Prayers that must
travel very, very far, as all prayers must, and which
needed the giant strength of great simplicity to
bring them to the end of their weary journey.</p>

<p class='c004'>So for the kings and princes. An arduous task
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>is theirs—bound thus with chains—God only knows
how hard! As each insidious little link might
whisper, telling its own small share in the universal
tale.</p>

<p class='c004'>In our world we always speak of “Church and
State”—a correct and steady way of speaking—but
in Lucifram ’tis always “State and Church,” and
that is why the palaces and kings claimed our
attention first.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Church, composed of temples, synagogues,
and priests, jumbled together in luxurious profusion,
was dressed and bedecked so finely that the God
the people worshipped fell almost out of sight. In
their chief temple, in the greatest city, was a three-tailed
golden Serpent, coiled around a golden pole
above a table decked in red, and set with incense
vessels. Dim and mysterious was that holy place,
where priests, all flowing and bedecked in golden
garments, came each day to bow before the Snake.
Its three tails, the gold of them burnished like fire,
spread out like fans on high, against a background
of mosaic. Below, resting on the altar, was the great
head, lying quite still; the genius of ages worked in
its cruel fangs and awful eyes. Eyes never closing,
jewel-glinting, green and fiery, all-surveying, all-watching.
Those terrible eyes lit up the gloom,
and compelled men to stand upon their heads as
it itself was forced to do. For by the grim and
dreadful fascination of those never-closing eyes,
unconsciously the worshippers changed to position
like to it, tails up, heads down, blinded by their
religion.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this temple the people sat in the big gloomy
aisles, each on a little chair with a ledge in front for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>kneeling, and heard the priest from the pulpit, and
the reader from his desk. Awed by the grandeur
and the solemn dimness, they bowed and salaamed
before the triune tails, hidden from the vulgar gaze
by a red silk curtain blazoned in gold. And when
the mighty organ rolled and rumbled, and the angel
voices of the choir boys rang through the gold-washed
rafters, their senses were stirred by some far hidden
mystery, and their eyes would dim or kindle as
they felt it; only the gleaming eyes within the
veil remained unchanged.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now it was customary for the priests who waited
on the Serpent to fast a day each month and marry
only once. A layman in Lucifram might wed
twice. No priests could marry under forty. For
laymen, the age was twenty-five for the first attempt,
and forty for the second; that is, for the few who
preferred company in their latter years to peace.
But though the women, by Act of Parliament, enjoyed
the privilege of marrying twice, just as the men did,
there were certain things clearly beyond them, they
being in Lucifram, as here, the weaker vessels. On
those great days whereon the priest drew back the
silken curtain and displayed the Serpent, all women
were debarred from entering the temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so enough for an explanation and a prologue.
Take my hand, descend, and tread on Lucifram!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>FRIEND AND EXECUTOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the capital of Lucifram there is a great park—a
city park—planted with trees sown centuries since
by the restless winds, when all was peaceful country.
To the right stretches the city—work and pleasure,
laughter and tears, and perpetual hurry-scurry. All
round the park sounds and sights of human life,
condensed within a curiously small circle, were in
evidence. Silent streets, tall and shadowy, lit by
occasional gas lamps, fringed on a brilliant thoroughfare,
with omnibuses, cabs, and people hurrying
everywhere. Most spacious squares, with fountains
and statues, backed by huge buildings, erected both
for grace and durability, lay on all sides. The
mansions on this side of the park were in many
cases of plain exterior. This gave the lie to the
magnificence within. On the right side of the park,
facing it and running along its entire length, was
built the famous Greensward Avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the centre of the avenue, standing back under
the shadow of the high walls of two palace gardens
rising on either side, stood a large square house built
of black marble. It was built in black, and the
blinds were of deep red, the only colour to relieve
it. Those were not visible till night came. Thirteen
imposing-looking steps lead up to an imposing door,
in black polished oak, rarely carved. Two narrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>windows in the wall reached down on each side of
it. The house consisted of three storeys and a
basement, and to the back were pretty and extensive
gardens protected by high walls.</p>

<p class='c004'>The owner of this house was a certain Camille
Barringcourt, who had but lately come there, within
the last three years. With the exception of servants,
he lived quite alone—a bachelor in the land of
double marriages.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the house in which he lived was very
appropriately called “Marble House.” It had been
built by a millionaire quite recently, despite its old
appearance. The reason why it had such an appearance
of age was because it had been erected from
a spoiled cathedral in the remotest corner of
Lucifram, where instead of worshipping the Serpent
they worshipped the Toad. It had cost a vast
amount of money to cart the marble and oak right
over from east to west, but it was done right
royally, and the house itself, from this point of view
at least, was very interesting. No sooner was the
great mansion completed, and royalty entertained
on one single occasion, than the millionaire died.
Men and women agreed on this, that his death was
at least mysterious. He was found dead in bed.
So far as the doctors could tell he suffered from
nothing, and had come by no foul play. He had
died painlessly, in the big plain bed-chamber containing
little else but the desecrated altar of the
Toad, with a fac-simile of the Serpent rising above
it—a shrine which all good people in Lucifram kept
in their private rooms. And so he was buried, and
the ladies mourned. He had been generous. And
then his will was read.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>All his vast wealth was given to charities; all
went to charity except the house. That was left
“To my friend, Camille Barringcourt, as a slight
token of esteem, and in remembrance of the past.”
That was all. No one had ever heard or seen anything
of this friend, and no one knew anything of
the past. But lawyers, like detectives, have a way of
hunting people up. In a little time it was spread
abroad that Camille Barringcourt lived in Fairysky,
or at least was staying there, a country which
much resembled Italy on the Earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may also be mentioned here that Camille
Barringcourt and the lawyer were left executors
of those vast charities.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first thing about the new-comer’s arrival that
excited general interest was the advent of six horses.
All were black as night, with long tails, fiery eyes,
shining coats, and tossing, untamed heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nearly all the little boys in that aristocratic
neighbourhood were late for school that morning;
or better, never went. Accustomed as they were
to beautiful horses, they had never even in their
experience seen anything to equal these. The
six black horses travelled through the crowded
thoroughfares singly led, each by a groom. Their
trappings were of a deep red, and no unnecessary
weight was placed upon them. The men who led
the animals were men who understood their
business, and had great patience with their
coquettish, curvetting ways. Just as the journey
was drawing to a close the traffic in the streets
was for the minute stopped. Five of the six
horses had passed the crossing, and the last was
drawn up close to Lady Flamington’s carriage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Whether it was her ladyship’s hat (she was one
of the best dressed and most beautiful women of
the day), or whether her two thoroughbreds were
ready to enter into the fun of the thing, and dance
a lively impromptu pirouette with the new arrival,
it would be hard to say. However, the black
steed began a dance, anything but safe in the
state of the crowded thoroughfare, and the bays
in harness did their best to follow suit. It was
a spirited attempt; then the groom for once lost
his temper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get up, you devil!” said he. The horse took
him literally and reared up, despite his efforts to
keep it down, dragging him with it, in its
wild, untamable fury. The trampling forepaws
struck on the cushions of my lady’s brougham.
What might have been the result it is impossible
to say, for her escape on the other side was cut off
by a huge lorry drawn up against her like a wall,
but just at that moment a voice fell on the hubbub
and the consternation, and the “voice that breathed
o’er Eden” on the day of her marriage had never
been so welcome to Lady Flamington as that one
now. At the same time a hand, the whitest, the
most beautiful she had ever seen (so she told her
friends after), grasped at the bridle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Waugh-o, Starlight—Starlight! Come, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words, the tone, the caressing hand on one
side, the firm hand on the bridle, were too much
for the four-legged beauty. Won over by more
words, more pressure on the hateful bit (even
though silver), and more caressing patting on her
glossy neck, she came gracefully down to earth
once more.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>It seemed to Lady Flamington that the stranger
had sprung up from nowhere. As a matter of
fact, he had sprung from the hansom behind,
in which he was following, at almost walking pace,
these six prancing treasures. Then just as the
traffic was starting again he looked across at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not hurt,” said he. “I should have been
bitterly sorry if that had happened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For once her ladyship could find no words. She
bowed, he raised his hat, the procession moved along.
Then she knitted her brows thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He should have been sorry in either case,” she
thought, and fell to studying his face in her memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile the six black horses had turned into
Greensward Avenue, where likewise at a quicker rate
her ladyship’s carriage was progressing.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the way to the spacious private stables at the
rear of the private grounds, Mr. Barringcourt, for it
was he, led that most spoiled of all spoilt animals,
Starlight. The little boys followed admiringly, till
the big doors of the stable-yard closed cruelly upon
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That looks like a dook turned undertaker,” said
one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rumour had spread a report that Camille Barringcourt
was a twice married gentleman, with a large
family.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How unlike poor Geoffrey Todbrook,” said the
ladies, and sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>But rumour for once was entirely wrong. One
bachelor was dead; another succeeded him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new arrival settled quickly into his new home.
Seeing it was already furnished, that was but natural.
His servants were all foreigners, dark, tall, all very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>unlike the people on this side of Lucifram. Yet
there was an inexpressible charm, dignity, and quiet
repose about them that delighted and mystified
everyone. Among them were some women, parlourmaids,
sewing-maids, and housemaids apparently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each one of these servants, men and women,
dressed in black, faced with deep red. It was a kind
of uniform.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, a few words are needed as to the personal
appearance of the Master himself. In figure he was
tall, athletic, graceful, broad-shouldered. His hair
was black and short, crisp at the ends, as Lady
Flamington noticed when he removed his hat.
People called his face “odd.” It was dark and
swarthy, with a strong forehead, and black eyes
which were gloomy and deeply set. The nose was
straight, bearing in its lines more sensitive refinement
than any other feature of his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he smiled he showed, though not obtrusively,
a sparkle of white and even teeth. When
Lady Flamington admired the beauty of his hands
she was within the right. For strength and suppleness
they would be hard to beat, and for whiteness
also. This then, in short, was the figure of Camille
Barringcourt, come to dispense the charity of his
friend of the past; come to settle in Marble House,
of Greensward Avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lady Flamington, some dozen houses off, persuaded
her first and only husband to call there,
soon after the arrival. He did so, hoping to see
the fine black horses she had spoken of. Horseflesh
was his hobby. He saw the gentleman, but
nothing else in the way of interest, took a sudden
fancy to him, and invited him over to dinner on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Friday night. The invitation was as suddenly
accepted. Sir James went home with some misgivings.
He didn’t know whether his wife liked
swarthy men; she was fastidious. His wife had
no objection to them. She was delighted to
welcome any of his friends, except turf acquaintances
and bookmakers.</p>

<p class='c004'>On Friday night Mr. Barringcourt came. It was
a little formal affair, one or two of the family
circle and an intimate friend. The stranger sat
beside his hostess for dinner, and they talked
commonplaces. At last she turned to him with a
pretty grace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have not yet demanded my thanks,” said
she.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For what?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know for what.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your thanks would necessitate my apologies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am surprised you never offered them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was unnecessary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There I must confess to some curiosity. Do
you remember you said to me, ‘You are not hurt.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” said he, and smiled—a smile all the
more charming as he bent his head to hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well!” she retorted. “I was hurt; your horse
frightened me. To be frightened is to be hurt.
Can you dispute it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never saw anyone stand pain better. Your
face was a vision of—of—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of what?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not understand your language very well,
as yet. I shall improve in it; you must be patient.
In a week or two I shall have found the word I
need.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“And till then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Learn to be gracious to a poor speaker.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! But I do not intend to let you off so easily.
After telling me I was not hurt, you next proceeded
to say, ‘In that case you would have been deeply
sorry’—you see my memory is good. Now, am I
to understand that under the circumstances you
felt no sorrow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most certainly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now we shall quarrel, unless you can explain
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it necessary?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall discover how much so if you do not
explain your meaning instantly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then do not blame me if I sink still deeper into
the mire. Under the circumstances, I was not sorry.
I had been told on coming to this country I should
find all the women forward—most of them ugly—the
remainder plain. After three days’ looking
round me I had come to the same conclusion.
Suddenly by the merest chance my eyes lighted
on you. Can you wonder I should feel no sorrow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She frowned, then laughed, and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you learn this grossest form of
flattery?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see your ladyship has no education to
appreciate the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Talk to my husband about horses. I have no
more to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he a lover of horses?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. He attends every Race Meet in the
county.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt smiled. “That speaks for itself,”
he said.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>ROSALIE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Let us pay a call on Cinderella.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alas! not a Cinderella with a prince and gorgeous
clothing, but one without a tongue, or rather, tongue-tied.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie Paleaf, for that was her name, lived alone
with an aunt and uncle. Both her parents were dead.
She was pretty, of that fair delicate type called
“picturesque.” Her hair was of a palish yellow
tint, glossy, but straight; her skin was fair and
delicate. The eyes were grey, with dark curling
lashes, and delicately marked brows. Her nose
turned up just the least little bit, the most charming
upward, delicate little curve in the wrong direction
it would be possible to meet. The corners of her
mouth, however, turned down with the saddest, most
wistful droop imaginable. In fact, there was only
one feature in her face that kept it from becoming
most woefully pathetic, and that was the little,
inquisitive, life-enjoying nose. To come back to
her eyes for finishing touches. Their greyness was
very pale. The pupils generally were large, with an
equally black rim along the edge of the iris. Inside
this rim the colour gradually paled to the pupil,
which gave her eyes a curiously bright appearance.
And then being tongue-tied! She had nothing she
could talk with but her eyes, and so she used them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Uncle and aunt were very kind to her. Who
indeed could help being that? She was the gentlest,
kindest creature, harmless and very helpless, with
the sweetest face, the happiest manner, and sunniest
smile upon occasions.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were people of moderate circumstances in a
very quiet way, and if Rosalie had not the hardest
work of the house to do, it was because her aunt
always insisted on doing it, with the help of an
occasional charwoman. And so, when very young,
she learnt to hem, and dust, and do the toasting.
Later she got promoted to wiping tea-things, then
dinner dishes, and ended as a fully-fledged young
housekeeper, ready to bake and cook, darn, and
make and mend, to sweep and dust, and do all work
that is useful.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beyond this her education had not progressed.
She could read and write, ’tis certain, but very little
more. Accomplishments were beyond the means of
her relations, and had they not been it would never
have struck them a child apparently quite dumb
should need such things. So she stayed at home and
was happy, except in the company of strangers, when
her sad defect made itself felt under their pitying
glances of surprise, however well they might try to
conceal them.</p>

<p class='c004'>But a child’s happiness often constitutes a woman’s
misery. As the years passed by Rosalie began to
feel her loneliness, her utter incapacity for the work
of the world. She felt also something deeper,
stronger, more unwordable. It was more real than
anything else in her life, yet, because unseen, it was
unsympathised with as having no existence. And
so, although her happiness was gradually becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>overshadowed, she never fully recognised it till one
October evening when she had turned twenty.</p>

<p class='c004'>To look at Rosalie the spectator would never have
taken her for that age. All her life had been spent
in one long silent dream—the privilege of childhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was the kind of autumn evening made for
thought and sadness. The sky was very clear, with
a suspicion of purple in it, and the gold of ages was
in the west. As she stood by her bedroom window
looking out at it, there came that terrible foreboding
of sadness and sorrow that seems to do its best to
crush young hearts, though perhaps it only moulds
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>And along with it came a longing for expansion,
a weariness of the endless routine, the companionless
silence and that nameless thirst after something, she
knew not what. How could Rosalie, walking in the
mist, having no speech or utterance, explain it even
to herself? She wanted something, the purple of the
sky suggested something—suggested, nothing more.
And from that day forward the nameless longing
grew, settling itself within her heart, finding no
happier outside quarters. I do not know that she
looked thinner or more frail, her physical strength
was too great for that. No one beyond herself knew
of the longing, and she attributed it all to discontent,
and tried to stifle it.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last one evening she understood. The
inordinate longing for speech rushed over her.</p>

<p class='c004'>But how to manage it? It is all very well to find
out what you want to do—but how to do it? There
was only one way—only one way, at any rate, that
suggested itself to her, and that way was prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, her religious education had not been exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>neglected, but Rosalie was one of those heedless
creatures who hear a little and invent a great deal.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had been told with great piety by her aunt
of the great golden Serpent, its wonderful power,
its relentless cruelty to those who crossed or vexed
it, its generosity to those who did as they were told,
and from those few rudimentary remarks she had
built up a little golden temple of her own, quite an
unseen spiritual affair, in which to worship the
Supreme Being of Lucifram. She certainly gave
to the gorgeous Serpent many qualifications she had
never been told it possessed, but what of that? She
was but a poor, helpless creature at best. But with
a reverent, far-away love she had always worshipped
the Serpent, although as a sex she had been given
to understand he reckoned her somewhat inferior.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now, sitting up in bed, there came to her one
of those terrible convictions, never to be misplaced,
that are in themselves the sheerest madness or the
sheerest sanity, that she must get her tongue untied.
And the Serpent, being the strongest of all powers
on Lucifram, was the likeliest to do it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next afternoon at five o’clock saw Rosalie kneeling
in the famous temple, her head buried in her
hands, praying in the silence as only sincerity and
helplessness can pray.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Serpent, give me my tongue! Let me talk,”
said she, a most natural request when coming from
a woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she went home quite comforted, as only the
simple can be.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One does not pray for nothing,” she thought
“I feel the Serpent heard me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And that night she was so happy, she did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>notice her uncle’s troubled look and silent way. She
did not mean to be selfish, she was thinking purely
of her prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some weeks went by, and every day she walked
to the temple and prayed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Serpent, give me my tongue! Let me
talk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But no answer came to her prayer, and at last she
got tired of kneeling down among the empty pews.
The building was so big that she felt quite far away,
so she picked up her courage and went up the big
aisle, right up through the choir stalls to the steps
rising towards the altar, hidden by the curtains. It
was legitimate for any woman to go so far. She was
perfectly within her right. So she went up the steps
and knelt down quietly beside the golden railing.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there she prayed to the unseen Serpent—prayed,
and believed it heard her. Then she went
home. How near she had been to that Unseen
Power! How fervently she had prayed! The
Serpent always answered prayer, always looked after
the helpless.</p>

<p class='c004'>On going home her ring at the door was answered
by a neighbour with a white face and swollen eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>What was the matter?</p>

<p class='c004'>An hour ago, soon after she went out, her uncle
had been brought home after a stroke. Since then
he had died, just after the arrival of the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie sank back against the lobby wall, her
hands by her sides, her eyes filled with horror.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your aunt is upstairs in the back bedroom,” said
the neighbour, who had told the story as quietly as
she could, as gently as its tragedy allowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie pulled herself together and went upstairs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>trying the bedroom door at the back. It opened, and
she was thankful. Her aunt sat in a chair, her head
buried in the pillow of the one spare bed. Rosalie
went to her and touched her shoulder. The elder
woman moved slowly, and then sat up, smoothing
her grey hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been here long enough,” she said dully. “I
must go and see to things. Sit here, Rosalie. It
isn’t for you to be about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her dull grief repelled all sad advances. From
the time that Rosalie found her lying there cramped
against the bed she showed no further signs of
weakness, no further signs of giving in, till the funeral
was over.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then when the blinds were drawn up once more,
and the November light had flooded the room, she
took her foster daughter in her arms and wept as
only a broken-hearted woman growing old can weep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We went to school together,” she said at last,
twisting her wet soiled handkerchief around her
fingers. After that she scarcely mentioned her
husband again.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now time showed a great difference in the
little household, in addition to its greatest loss.
Money troubles and worry, of late months thickening
ominously, had helped to bring about the sudden
end. There were no more happy meals at tea-time,
no bread to toast, nothing but the barest, rude
necessities of life. For they were poor, so poor that
they scarcely knew how to look the future in the
face. Both were very helpless.</p>

<p class='c004'>The elder woman in a few short months had grown
old, shrunken, and thin. She tried at times to smile
bravely, to take interest in life and neighbours, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>life and interest had gone for her in the old playfellow
and life love. And more and more each day
since her uncle’s death Rosalie felt the want of speech.
She could give none of that bright assistance that
was needed. No better than a living shadow she was
bound to go about the house. Yet still she went to
the temple to pray in humility and faithfulness.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then, as the spring came round, she heard
vague, disquieting rumours of the little house being
shut up. Her aunt was going to live with a married
brother, whose wife had little in common with her,
and she herself, Rosalie, was to be sent to a Home
for the Deaf and Dumb and Blind, a large charitable
institution, greatly enlarged and improved upon by
the munificence of a dead millionaire, one Geoffrey
Todbrook by name. Insufferable thought! To
separate her from the only human being she had
learnt to love, shutting them each within a dungeon
of strangers! “O God! O Serpent!” What
of the prayer of months, to give one atom in the
multitude the powers of speech? Prayer of presumption!
Its punishment the taking away of everything
that makes some lives worth living, the precious gift
of freedom.</p>

<p class='c004'>And yet Rosalie set her lips hard, there was no
drooping, and went once more, with faith supremely
high, but heart all wrong and tortured, to kneel and
pray to God within the temple.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE GOLDEN SERPENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The afternoon was cold and gloomy, and by the
time Rosalie reached the temple the little light that
ever came there had quite died away. There were
no Americans in Lucifram, no English tourists either,
consequently the sacred building from morn to eve
was silent as the grave except for matins and for
evensong. But evensong was held at seven, and now
it was but four.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s heart was in that terrible state of aching
which approaches physical pain. Speechless, she
knew herself quite helpless.</p>

<p class='c004'>For lack of speech she must be separated from one
who had suddenly grown more helpless than herself,
one whom she could not bear to part with, one who
had grown accustomed to her great defect, and had
never labelled on the door those words: “Home for
the Blind—the Deaf—the Dumb—Incurables.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Once I get inside there I am dumb for ever,” she
cried to herself, as she stumbled up the darkening
aisle. “Oh, I cannot go—I cannot! I want to live
like other people. To be free—free—free!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so she knelt down beside the altar railings,
and buried her face in her hands against its golden
bars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Serpent, let me speak! Give me a tongue
like other people have. I cannot go to that asylum—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>cannot really. I cannot live without my aunt.
We are all in all to each other. What good am I
if I remain a speechless log? I might as well be
dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>No answer. Darkness and silence. That was all.
The impenetrable hardness of it sank to Rosalie’s
heart. Suddenly she got up and looked round
cautiously, with pale face and dark-rimmed eyes.
There was no noise. Nothing moved in the empty
building save herself. Silent and trembling, she took
a step forward inside the railing, then another, and
her hand touched the crimson curtain. Again she
looked around, assured herself again that she was
quite alone, silently drew back the heavy fold and
stepped within. The lights upon the altar, burning
by day and night, changed the dull gloom to brightness.
Her wandering, awe-struck gaze fell full upon
the Serpent, its head and jewelled eyes all shining
underneath the slowly swinging lights.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here, then, was the hidden God that all things
worshipped. This was the God who punished some,
rewarded others, and wore the creeds of ages on its
three-pronged tail. Her eyes were dazzled by the
brilliancy, but the Serpent’s wisdom gleaming from
those curious eyes attracted her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give me what I want! Give me what I want!”
she whispered, and stretched out her white arms till
her hands had clasped behind the Serpent’s head.
Then she leant forward and pressed her lips against
the cruel, hardened, lifeless fangs, and whispered yet
again:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give me what I want—just so that I may serve
you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>As silently she unclasped her fingers, rising to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>feet. She passed down the three steps leading from
the altar, and became aware, with beating heart and
sudden tumultuous fear, that she had been watched.</p>

<p class='c004'>For, stepping from the side way, came a stranger,
stopping her progress outward to the other side of
the veil.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it that you want?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>In his eyes there shone the priceless worth of
wisdom’s jewels, giving them in their brilliant
expression something of the same impenetrable light
the Serpent’s had.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie became confused, and mixed the two
together. How could she help it, seeing both had
come together? But no words were there for utterance.
She raised her hand to her mouth, her eyes to
his face—eyes that had grown in sadness and in
beauty throughout a lifetime—and then she shook
her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dumb?” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that what you came to pray about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again she nodded. She looked up at him, and
her eyes sank. After all, it was the secret of a life,
for none knew of these daily visits to the temple, and
now a stranger had discovered it—the secret which
had been guarded so jealously all these years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you come in here to pray often?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head vehemently, and pointed
outside.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see. You stay outside?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again she nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he held the curtain aside, and she passed out,
he following her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The church without was black.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Rosalie gave a muttered cry of dismay—the
building was so large, its pews, and steps, and
labyrinths all so intricate. But her companion produced
a light that glowed like a thin taper, but burnt
with a clearer and a stronger light, and plainly lit
the church around them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never trust to the church to give you light,” said
he whimsically, “unless, as now, you penetrate to
the Holy of Holies!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie smiled; she felt it was but polite,
unaccustomed as she was to strangers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Together they walked down the long aisle, and
once she stole a glance up at him sideways, with
great curiosity, to see what he was like. But the
stranger was looking at her, and she bent her head
downward again. She evidently did not possess the
gift of sweet unconsciousness of self.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I presume you wished to come away?” he said at
the end of their journey, before he opened the heavy
doors.</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent must be very cruel and hardened if
he withstand such a prayer as that you offered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was more amusement than pity in his
voice and expression. Rosalie felt, but did not
understand it. Never had anyone in her narrow
life been able to put so much expression into a mere
hand-touch. In gratitude she could have taken and
kissed it many times.</p>

<p class='c004'>They passed out on to the high steps leading from
the temple. The rain was coming down in torrents.
The street lamps glistened through it, and the
passers-by were infrequent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“How are you going home?” he said. The outside
world seemed to have separated them.</p>

<p class='c004'>She pointed to her feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Walking? Well, hurry and don’t get wet. It
would be a pity to spoil the prayer by leaving no
time for its fulfilment. Good-night!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he moved away a step or two, and she
stopped to put up her umbrella. Suddenly, however,
he turned round, and came with quick strides
toward her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See, here is my card. When you have made
headway with the Serpent, and received an answer to
your prayer, come and see me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he scribbled on the back of the card “Admit
Bearer,” and then handed it to her, once more leaving
her standing on the steps.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie, having succeeded in getting up the
umbrella, and gathering up her skirts, turned in the
direction of home. It was a walk of about twenty
minutes, and all the way she thought of the stranger,
of his interesting face, deep eyes and mellow voice,
his hand laid so kindly on her shoulder. She remembered,
also, that sudden perceptible change when
outside the church, a mixture of harshness and
coldness and pride, more shown in his manner than
his words.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder what he was doing inside the curtain?”
she thought. “Perhaps he had gone there to pray
like me. I hope I did not disturb him.” Then she
sighed. “He looked a rich man, and he could say
whatever he wanted to. There could be nothing he
was wanting half so much as I.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On reaching home she was met by her aunt. As
soon as they were seated at the frugal tea, the lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>explained that a Mr. Ellershaw, an acquaintance of
her dead husband, had called that afternoon to see
her. On hearing how matters stood, and the separation
that was imminent, he had told her of a post of
caretaker he knew to be vacant, where the work was
to look after a large building in the city let out in
flats to different business men. There would be a
certain amount of work to do in connection with
this—and he did not know whether either of them
would care for such a post; but it was there if they
wished. It would ensure them living together, four
rooms in the topmost storey. Rosalie looked across
her tea-cup and nodded her head eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You like such a prospect?” her aunt asked
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be very hard work, and I am not as
strong as I used to be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie held out her hands and looked at them
triumphantly. Then she pointed to herself, and
smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think you could undertake some of it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>So together they wrote a letter accepting the post,
and a week later left their old home, with all its
memories and associations, to settle in a fifth storey
dwelling amongst the skylights.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie felt her prayer in part was answered. They
were not to be separated after all. Hard as the
work might be, it meant freedom and the company
she loved. She was content, went to the temple,
knelt humbly and returned thanks. Then she went
on praying for a voice with a faith born of simplicity
and her own idea of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>One day a priest found her praying there. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>inquired the cause. Like the stranger, he was not
long in finding it. He put his hand upon her head,
and blessed her in the name of the Serpent’s three
tails. Then he went back to the priests’ lodgings,
and kept his story for supper. He was a jolly man,
of the earth earthy, and his idea of the Serpent was
that his golden coils were lucrative. The priest was
not bad-hearted; he was simply mediocre. But he
had a sense of humour—and who, indeed, but the
soured and stupid have not?—and the idea of a girl
kneeling by the altar railings (he had never seen her,
as on that one unique occasion, step beyond) praying
persistently to be allowed to talk when plainly she
was physically beyond it tickled his sense of funniness.
He laughed and shook till the tears ran down
his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And she believes it—<em>that’s</em> the biggest joke,” he
cried. “Believes that if she prays long enough the
Serpent will weary or turn merciful, and fulfil her
prayer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“According to our history of the past, with its
wonders and miracles, that is not so impossible as it
seems,” said one, more thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’d best jump back a hundred year or two,
and cap one miracle by another, then,” remarked a
third.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did you say to her, James Peter?” asked a
fourth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I blessed her, and prayed to the Serpent to
look serious, and the request was granted. ’Twas a
miracle on a small scale, I can assure you. I could
have roared right out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is she like to look at?” put in a fifth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty—sad-looking—just the sort of woman to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>get an idea. That is the sort we can’t afford to
quarrel with. They tip so handsomely on Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Little or tall?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, tall! Medium, at any rate. Couldn’t smile if
she tried. Sacred liver of the Serpent! What a sermon
for one of you fellows with a love of sentiment to
preach on Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait till the woman is made whole, and sitting
in the congregation. Then our fortunes are secured,”
said another drily.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in this respect the priests of the Serpent were
very different from our own. Amongst themselves
they never acted the hypocrite—the heathen idolaters!</p>

<p class='c004'>So next day, when Rosalie went to pray, one or
two passed in and out silently to behold the phenomenon.
After a time they grew accustomed, and
took no further notice of her. After all, a woman
might as well spend her time in an attitude of humble
devotion. Experience generally proved those to
make the best sort of wives.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie and her aunt had been established a little
over six months in the new home, and the work was
so hard and unaccustomed that it was beginning to
tell on both of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The older woman was little better than a breakdown
before she came, and gradually without much
complaint, but growing silence, she sank into the bed
of weakness more. It was a sickness from which
she never rose.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had been too old to face these sudden changes,
was not made of the stuff that endures, or not enduring,
fights. So then this cloud had only risen in
mockery to sink the heavier. Where was Rosalie’s
prayer of love and thanksgiving?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The last week of her aunt’s illness was very strange
and unreal to Rosalie—strange and unreal when,
after the second funeral within a year, she sat alone
in the little empty four-roomed storey.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her hands, roughened, though not coarsened, by
hard work, were clasped between her knees. Her
head had sunk forward on her breast, her open eyes
saw nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Vaguely she hoped that she might be the next to
go, thought of her prayer for speech, and dashed the
bitter tears from her dull eyes. What of her prayer?
Perhaps to the Serpent it sounded nothing more than
clamorous presumption and self-will.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again she had been offered the shelter of the
Home for Deaf and Dumb by those who recognised
her sad position. Was she ungrateful? Many poor
waifs there were, she knew, in that great city, with
none to help them to the scantiest food and
shelter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t believe you’re either kind or just, and I won’t
pray to you any more!” she cried inwardly, jumping
up fiercely at last. “I wasn’t made to be without
a tongue. I wasn’t! I wasn’t! You haven’t the
power to give me one; that’s what it really is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But no bricks and mortar fell to punish such an
outburst.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What have I done that I should be left here
alone?” she continued. “I want to go along with
aunt and uncle. You know I do. I can’t live here
alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But there was no answer. Gradually a calmer
spirit came over her, together with a wish to find out
that sphinx-like secret that wrapped itself in icy
silence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“What’s the good of making me want to talk if
you won’t let me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Out of the vast silence a voice seemed to shape
itself at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give up! Sacrifice!” it said.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was such a very beautiful voice, and yet so very
cold, that Rosalie shrank from it. Sacrifice was such
a heathenish thing! Besides, what was there to
sacrifice in the way of a tongue—she hadn’t got one,
not a serviceable one, at any rate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent’s will comes first with all believers,”
cried the same voice out of the silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish we could agree,” said Rosalie, with no
disrespect, and then fell a-thinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes. After all, it came to the old, old thing.
A clashing of wills—one human, one divine—if such
it could be called. And therein lay the only sacrifice
that God or the Serpent ever needed. It meant the
sacrifice of will.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly and clearly the truth unfolded itself. If her
faith were pure and unselfish, she must be willing to
give up longing and praying for that which was
beyond her, and still love and serve the Serpent even
without reward.</p>

<p class='c004'>And to what path did her duty point? The
thankful acceptance of a shelter that was offered, a
gentle surrender without bitterness into God’s hands.
An ending of a prayer He thought fit not to answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>It meant a great deal to Rosalie. The priest had
laughed at her simpleness in expecting the performance
of a miracle. Perhaps would all else had they
heard it; but to her it was a very real thing, the
outcome of real belief, that left a shattered feeling of
disappointment when the ending came.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“I thought the Serpent always answered prayer
when it was real,” she said, and felt suddenly like
one moving uncertainly in unknown lands amongst
a host of strangers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The time was drawing round to autumn again, and
now that her aunt had been removed, arrangements
were being made for her going. Within the week,
she had been told, she would go the Home. Those
who had interested themselves on her behalf did not
like to think of the lonely girl. The doctor who had
attended the aunt and uncle had very kindly made
it his business to remove all delays, such as often
took place for those who were admitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another woman, older and stronger, and more
accustomed to the work, was engaged. She had
been there for some time before her aunt’s death.
Rosalie, in this new and quiet mood, recognised the
kindness that had been shown to her on all sides.
But though she was truly thankful, she could raise no
enthusiasm. The next day, when afternoon came,
she dressed herself as carefully as her worn clothes
would allow, and went once more towards the
temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>But with what different feelings! For two years
past she had gone always with the same earnest
prayer, with no doubt of its acceptance, and now she
was going to give up the prayer and everything that
made her life worth living.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was just such another wet, dull day as that a
year ago when, with excess of feeling, she had drawn
aside the sacred curtain and stept within the Holy
Place.</p>

<p class='c004'>To-day, as usual, she went and knelt beside the
railings. All was growing dark. The same silence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the same utter emptiness, pervaded the temple now,
as then. Now, as then, the great longing seized her
to pass within the veil. So silently she rose, drew
back the curtain stealthily, and stept within. The
Serpent’s steadfast gaze demanded her first glance.
Then she looked round, but perceived no stranger.
Assured, she ascended the steps and knelt beside the
gorgeous table. With tenderness and love, the outcome
of simplicity and pure devotion, she clasped
her hands once more about the Serpent’s head,
kneeling before it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sorry,” she whispered, her lips close to the
terrible mouth. “I made a god of my own tongue
instead of you. But now I understand. And, oh!
Serpent, teach me the right way to live, and keep me
from growing bitter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, as before, she imprinted a light kiss, tender
and loving, on the unkissable mouth, and silently
bowed her head some minutes on the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then on a sudden Rosalie rose, her eyes wide
open, and stared at the golden god. They stared in
wonderment, but growing understanding. The light
of dawning wisdom was in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>One minute, two minutes, three, passed away.
She turned round suddenly, emerged into the church,
dark now as once before about a year ago. A light
was in her hand; she cared not how she came by it,
but partly knew.</p>

<p class='c004'>A priest from one of the choir stalls was watching
her, with a feeble candle in his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>He called out “Treason! Blasphemy!” to see a
woman thus emerge from behind the sacred curtain.
It was James Peter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rushing forward, he slipped over a footstool, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>fell down heavily. His light was extinguished. Down
the vast aisle, with the lightness of a spirit, Rosalie
ran. Her eyes were laughing, a flush was on her
once pale cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>James Peter, rising, followed her. He puffed and
groaned at every priestly step.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when the door was open she turned and
nodded to him in the distance. The door closed.
He was in darkness. He had followed solely upon
her light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not till the lights were brought for Evensong did
he extricate himself from the toils of the massive
building. Then he told his tale.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you she turned round at the door and called
to me ‘Bon soir, monsieur! Adieu!’” he cried for
the third time to his companions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good Lord! What does it mean?” said one.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was she not dumb?” asked a second.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As dumb as the Serpent!” replied James Peter.
“She went into the Holy Place, and is cured.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A woman in the Holy Place!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes! I called ‘Blasphemy!’ but the damned
footstool tripped me! Had it not been for that I
had caught her and brought her up before the great
High Priest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A footstool tripped you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t speak so sneeringly, brother Thomas John.
I said a footstool tripped me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you lost the woman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What could I do without a light?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strike matches.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I followed her eyes till the door closed, and forgot
about them. Besides, not being a smoker, I never
carry any.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Did you say you found a woman in the Holiest
Place?” asked others, crowding round.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not find her there, I saw her coming out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Coming out! And never stopped her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we must find her. What is her address?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. What’s the punishment when we
have found her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In olden times it was to have her tongue torn out
by the roots.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the Serpent had just given her one, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nowadays, I expect, the punishment will be
modified. Strict silence on penalty of death, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But if the Serpent has given her a tongue, who
then dare take it away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How has the Serpent given her one?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you, before she was dumb.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible! No woman was ever so afflicted—worse
luck!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you she was dumb, and is cured. She said
to me at the door, ‘Bon soir, monsieur. Adieu!’
Very pretty words,” and he mimicked the tone and
gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is sheer madness. There is no sense in the
words!” cried another.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it necessary for women to speak sense?”
asked James Peter.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the others laughed. He looked dangerous.
And so they talked, and all gesticulated. But the
mistake was on the part of James Peter—in part, at
least.</p>

<p class='c004'>He never heard the lady speak. It was his own
imagination which coined strange words without
meaning.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE MASTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Rosalie outside the temple never paused, apparently,
to think. She did not take the direction of her old
home, but flew on as if scarcely touching the ground
towards that portion of the city where lay the
mansions and the ancient park. The usually
crowded streets were almost deserted, the rain kept
wayfarers within doors. Nothing hindered her rapid
movements onward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Greensward Avenue was one long vista of shining
pavements, dripping trees, and glistening street
lamps. Here and there brighter lights shone from
the entrances to houses. But on Rosalie sped till
she came to the central house, which stood a little
back behind high iron palings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door had two leaves, and opened inward from
the centre. There was a vestibule beyond, and then
another double door of thickest glass, polished and
cut to shine like diamonds. Above the hall door
a deep red lamp was burning, which cast its light
well out into the street. The only furniture within
the vestibule was a broad chair of oak, and a massive
umbrella stand all carved with hideous faces, very
ancient, no doubt, but not exactly beautiful.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie noticed these as she stood on the top step
touching the bell, and because each face was very
fascinating she would have continued looking at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>them had not the inner door opened upon the
instant.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not a creaking door. It opened noiselessly
and swiftly, and in the doorway stood a man.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had none of the superabundant dignity
generally associated with the servants in rich houses.
His hair was not powdered, his dress was plain, and
black.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie, so swift and impetuous until now, came to
a standstill. She looked at him, and he at her. She
had no voice with which to explain her errand, and
suddenly remembered her only chance of admittance
there was the card. For it was to Marble House
she had come, the house of the man whom she had
met in the temple just a year ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it that you want?” he asked. These
were the exact words with which she had been
greeted by the master.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she remembered the card was hidden away
in the bosom of her dress in a little silken bag she
had made in an idle moment for it months ago.
She must produce it, that was evident, and trust
to Providence to do the rest. She turned round
towards the many-headed umbrella stand, and began
to extricate the card of introduction. The man
stood there waiting, and when she turned round,
flushed and flurried, holding the card, and glancing
at him suspiciously to trace the smile upon his lips,
she found nothing there, not even surprise. He
evidently was old enough to be beyond it</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie pointed to the back; he read it, then
motioning her to sit in the chair facing the hydra-headed
umbrella stand, went in once more behind
the polished doors and closed them after him.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The door opened silently again before long.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come this way,” said the low, serious voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doors swung to behind them. They entered
upon a large square hall. It was not brilliantly
lighted, and the farther end was dim and scarcely
discernible. But every thing was rich and massive,
and highly polished. It reminded her in some indescribable
way of the temple she had just left. Carved
oak chairs, just as those seen in the sacred building,
lined the walls, standing round in a perfect square,
except where interrupted by some other article of
furniture. These chairs seemed to be endless.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Rosalie passed along she became accustomed
to the dimness, and noticed from this farther end a
spiral staircase ascending to the upper floor. It was
built in polished oak, and went round and round in
a way that reminded her of the Serpent’s coils. It
led to a gallery that overlooked the hall on all sides.</p>

<p class='c004'>Three double glass doors of the same peculiar
lustre as the entrance (which made the fourth) led
out of this hall, one on each side, one being beyond
the staircase.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her companion passed through that door to the
left, and she followed him. They came upon a
corridor, and stopped before the last door on the
left-hand side. Her guide knocked, then opened
it. There was no name to give; Rosalie had no
tongue to speak, no card to show. Then the door
closed again, and she found herself in the presence
of the man whom she had come to seek.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was sitting by a table reading. A fire was
burning in the hearth near by. A high shaded
lamp stood on the ground beside him. The floor
was thickly carpeted, the walls were lined with books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>from floor to ceiling, one other door led from the
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Master looked up as she entered, then got
up, pushing the book away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you have come,” he said. He came forward
and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie, trembling and uncertain, returned the
hand-shake, nodding.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What! you cannot speak yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head, but as he was withdrawing
his hand she clutched it eagerly, unconscious of
anything but this one little sinking straw of hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>This time he looked at her more closely. “What
is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>She raised her other hand to her throat and mouth,
then pointed to him, her eyes full on his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not the Serpent,” he answered, and he shook
his head and tried to disengage his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie’s fingers tightened with a fierceness
and determination altogether foreign to her. Her
cheeks flushed, her eyes flashed angrily; she gave
one little imperious stamp with her foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Master looked at her and smiled—a smile that
travelled from his eyes to the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see. You do not intend to go till I have
performed an—an impossibility?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie nodded in all seriousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is the gift of speech you’re wanting?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s very dangerous; leads people into all kinds
of indiscretions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head vehemently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think you differ from the commonality?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie neither shook her head nor nodded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>She only looked up at him with no other expression
in her eyes except dumb entreaty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come to the light,” said he, “and try to look less
ghostly. After all, if you can’t be cured you can’t.
You’re brave enough to stand that, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again she nodded, still looking at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He pushed the shade of the lamp up. “Now open
your mouth,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Obediently Rosalie did as she was told.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, you’ve got a tongue!” said he, bending his
brows, and stooping down to her. “Can’t you
move it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie could not. It was complete paralysis
of the muscles evidently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come with me, and I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He led her through the other door into another
room. The walls of this place were lined with chests
and cupboards with glass fronts, containing curious
instruments. In the centre was a long table. The
room was also fitted up with chairs such as dentists
use, and a marble washing basin fitted with water
pipes, hot and cold.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet when the light was turned on the general
effect was cheerful. Rosalie found it so, at any
rate, for renewed hope was springing in her heart.
She sat down upon the chair he drew for her, and
watched him whilst he went to the cupboard and
brought out something shaped like a very long
darning needle. It was thick at one end, very fine
and pointed at the other. Then from another shelf
containing flasks of glass polished and cut he took a
liquid shining like silver, and poured some into a tiny
crucible. With these he came back to her and placed
them on the table. Then he looked at her, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“This will hurt you very much,” he said; “but you
asked for it, so you will have to go through with it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Anyone but Rosalie would have noticed that the
expression of his face was not particularly kind. But
she noticed nothing. She leant back against the
head-rest; he placed his hand upon her eyes. After
that they were too heavy for her to open them. She
opened her mouth instead.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a curious kind of pain, if pain it could be
called. Never in the whole of her life had she ever
felt anything so soothing. She could not tell how
long the sensation lasted, but it ceased very suddenly.
Then although her eyes were closed she felt (this was
the curious part of it) a strong light shining into her
mouth, right back to the roots of that so far silent
tongue. It was a light that had the power to heal and
strengthen, and for a long, long time it played upon
every unused nerve and delicate muscle. At last all
was over; the master laid his hand upon her eyes
again and opened them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said he, “the miracle has been performed.
Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c004'>From long custom Rosalie nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must speak,” he answered, laughing, “if but
to show your appreciation of the gift.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you,” she said, quite perfectly, with just a
little break in the word that took nothing from its
sweetness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you find the pain very bad?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I nev-er felt it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never felt it?” he repeated. “Give me your
hand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But her pulse was even, and he frowned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you come from when you came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>me?” he asked, bending his eyes down to hers with
a keen, penetrating glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I came from the temple.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From the prayer?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you—” but here he stopped. “I see,” he
continued, but in reality he didn’t.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you expect I should be hurt?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can hardly believe you were not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I should have screamed. I made no sound.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was scarcely possible. For my own part,
I always think it best to guard against screams,
they are so unhelpful and unnecessary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Rosalie looked at him, with eyes just as
keen and penetrating as his had been.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you stare at me?” he asked, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To see if you are disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be careful. Your tongue is getting rather out
of bounds already.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think you would rather have enjoyed my
being hurt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what can you expect in a country
where vivisection is disallowed? One must take
what little pleasure one can get.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he led the way back into the outer room.
When they were both through he turned the key
and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I rarely go in there,” he said. “Few folks are
fool enough to come to me. I have no ambition to
become a doctor, and I shun the popularity that
hangs upon the quack.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They were both standing by the table now, one
on either side. Rosalie’s eyes were fixed dreamily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>on a large glass ink-stand in the centre of the table.
She was beginning to feel indescribably tired.
There was nothing very wonderful in this, the
operation had lasted longer than she was aware.
But though tired, she was feeling remarkably light-hearted,
longing to get outside and give herself
two or three decided pinches to become convinced
she was awake, and that this great good fortune of
her prayer had at last come to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>But over and above the tired feeling and the
unreality came gratitude to her deliverer. The
thought of this made her suddenly raise her eyes
and look across at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Certainly his face was very proud, and the shadows
lurking underneath his eyes and at the corners of
his mouth gave it a dark, forbidding expression.
It was not altogether pleasant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The feature I like best is his nose,” thought
Rosalie. “The one that frightens me most is his
mouth; the one that most interests me is his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have been very kind to me,” she said. “Is
there any way in which I can pay you back?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not think you could give me anything
tangible, but perhaps you yourself will be able to
suggest something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie flushed to the roots of her hair. “I haven’t
anything,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not even a soul?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That part of you which under certain conditions
becomes immortal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That part of me belongs to the Serpent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent passed you on body and soul to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“The Serpent did nothing of the sort,” she
answered vehemently, if slowly. “I—I—I—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyebrows came together in a frown.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he answered quietly, “there is one way
in which you can pay me back. Speak the truth
in answering my questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll try,” said Rosalie meekly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then put an ending to that ‘I—I—I—.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I came because I thought it was time. I got
a little bit tired of the Serpent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because it never took any notice of me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s curious eyes looked up innocently and
met his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does that surprise you very much?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I confess that it does.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know, I’m very tired. If you don’t mind,
I’ll come again to-morrow and talk it over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But he shook his head, and smiled again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think I’ll let you go,” he said. “Your
answers are not very satisfactory. Besides, where is
there you can go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, with a tongue one can go anywhere and do
anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And here from sheer weariness and exhaustion she
slipped down in the arm-chair beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had been a very hard day, and the ending
had told upon her strength. She had not fainted,
however, she was only sleeping.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Mr. Barringcourt crossed the room and looked at
her very narrowly, even dropping on one knee to
examine her features more nearly.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a very pale, thin, and tired face he looked
at, delicate and fragile, with dark lashes, and faint
blue shadows underneath the closed eyes. The backs
of her hands were rough, and he took each up and
examined it as though he had been a fortune-teller—back
and front.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he began walking slowly back and forwards
through the room. His face, though handsome
after a kind, was certainly not of the most prepossessing;
and yet in repose his expression was one
of weariness and contempt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What shall I do with her?” he muttered. “Keep
her to prevent blabbing as usual. Keep her and
bring her up to talk properly. When she is old
enough, or rather fit enough, I’ll let her out on a
lease long enough to take her to the devil. Always
the same! everlastingly the same! coming and going,
with nothing to give and everything to ask. Dull to
the very core, chattering like magpies, smiling and
aping God knows what! Rich and poor, all of them
alike. And for some reason best known to myself
I stand it. What an excellent patient fisherman I
should make!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he sat down again very deliberately in his
chair, and drew the book he had been reading towards
him, at the same ringing a bell. The same man who
had admitted Rosalie answered it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take her away, and see she doesn’t get out,” said
he, without looking up; and the other evidently
understood so well that he never asked a question.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>NEW EXPERIENCES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Rosalie awoke next morning, it was with a
pardonable sense of bewilderment and estrangement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Instead of the little bedroom, bare of carpet, and
devoid of all furniture, except the poorest and the
simplest, she found herself in one that was really
palatial.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bed had deep hangings of red silk, and she
was not up to date enough to tear them down as
breeding microbes and all things unhealthy. Then
by degrees, her eyes travelling beyond the bed, she
gradually became acquainted with the other things
within the room, washstand, dressing-table, sofa,
chairs; and here Rosalie gave a squeal of delight, and
jumped out of bed, for there opposite was a wardrobe,
as respectable as carved black oak could make it.
But it was not the wardrobe that attracted her
attention so much as the mirror set full length in its
middle door—a mirror larger than she had ever
seen before or dreamt about. Rosalie was not vain,
but she had always entertained a great longing to
see her feet at the same time as her head, and had
thought it only a luxury and privilege accorded to
the rich. When she had become accustomed to this
novel vision she walked over towards the windows.
Here, so far as beauty was concerned, a disappointment
waited on her. All three of them looked upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>a high blank wall opposite. It gave a sense of
extreme dulness to the place.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just then her explorations and discoveries were cut
short by a knock at the door, and on it entered a
woman carrying a tray holding a cup of tea. Rosalie,
who understood nothing of this sort of thing, stared
at it and the bearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m quite better now, thank you,” she said,
shaking her head. “I was a little tired last night.
I’d rather not have my breakfast in bed, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is not your breakfast,” said the other, in a
voice so well modulated that many seemingly more
exalted might have envied it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, what is it?” said Rosalie, standing still
with her hands behind her looking at it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A cup of tea to help you to dress.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She had the sweetest voice imaginable. Rosalie
thought it the saddest she had ever heard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shan’t be ten minutes dressing,” she replied
decidedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quite an hour, I should say,” replied the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh!” gasped Rosalie. Then she clapped her
hands together, caught up the flowing robe and
skipped across the room to the bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I’m not dressed in ten minutes, my name’s
not Rosalie Paleaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then with a sudden change to alarm in her
manner, she turned round, growing alternately hot
and cold.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say, where are my things? I can’t see them
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I took them away last night. There are your
clothes for the day.” And she directed her attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>to a chair on which some very pretty and expensive
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lingerie</span></i> was laid.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at it, then drew herself up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want my own clothes,” she said. “These are
too good for me; the others might be poor, but they
were my own.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid you cannot have them; you must
dress in these.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The tears rose in Rosalie’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want my own clothes,” she said again.
“Auntie and I cut and made them together.
They were the last pair of stockings that she
ever knit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you bring them back?” said Rosalie at last,
the tears still standing in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid it is against the rules of the house.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie got up with a sigh, and prepared to
get inside the first garment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is your bath first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never bath in the morning; I always leave that
till night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think you had better do that which is
customary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Rosalie sighed, and followed her
tormentress to an adjoining bath-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so it took her well on into the hour before
she was dressed, ready to leave the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana, who stayed to help her, insisted on
arranging her hair, and after all arranged it much
more becomingly than Rosalie herself had ever
done.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the black robe with its red silk facings, that
fitted her companion so becomingly, suited her not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>at all. The fit was as perfect as it could be, but
otherwise she looked quite out of place in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Breakfast was served on the same floor as that on
which her bedroom was—three rooms away.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this portion of the house evidently looked out
on to nothing better than the wall mentioned before;
but the beauty of the interior compensated for outside
gloom. Rosalie was charmed with everything
she saw, though somewhat awe-struck, and she took
her breakfast shyly from the hands of what she
described to herself as the handsomest man she had
ever seen. She also made a mental note that he
must be brother to the man she saw downstairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie had not gone all this time without grateful
remembrance of that ordinary gift she had come to
possess; but somehow there was some vague,
indescribable thing in her surroundings that took
away a full appreciation. She was longing to be
outside, to talk with people more like herself, not all
in black with red silk facings and knee breeches, and
voices modulated to a soft perfection.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s voice was sweet, but it was not the
sweetness found in theirs. Hers was the outcome of
expression, theirs of classical harmony. But how
was she to get away? She dare not ask Mariana,
for she was getting an uncomfortable idea that
Mariana, from no ill motive, always thwarted and
opposed her. So, watching her opportunity, she
escaped and passed down the spiral staircase.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the big hall below all was silent as death.
Evidently no one was about.</p>

<p class='c004'>She ran across to the big doors with a palpitating
heart—outside them was freedom, she scarcely knew
from what.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Alas! Another hand had touched the large glass
handle before her own.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your card, madam. Your passport out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have none. I shall not be away five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid you cannot go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I must go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no answer. Exasperated, Rosalie stood
and faced him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You let me in, and you can let me out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The orders are that you are not to pass.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whose orders?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The master’s.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then take me to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is engaged at present.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll go myself, then.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>A DEBT OF GRATITUDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>As Rosalie passed along the corridor her sudden
decision was sealed by growing annoyance and a
longing, almost amounting to fear, to get away.</p>

<p class='c004'>With scarcely a pause she knocked upon the door,
that door through which she entered last night.
Without stopping she opened it. Mr. Barringcourt
was there alone, at a table littered with papers,
writing. He was indeed busy and engrossed, for on
her entrance he did not raise his head, till accosted
by her voice, and then he looked up sharply enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You!” said he, bringing his eyebrows together
in that dark frown which Rosalie had seen last night,
and seeing had never forgotten.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I want to go out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible!” said he, with an impatient gesture
of his hand, and returned to the paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to go out,” she repeated. “And you
have no right to stop me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In my own house I have every right. Go away,
you are interrupting me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So are you interrupting me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed, not altogether kindly, and looked up
at her again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is little short of impudent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t care. I want to go out, and if you won’t
give me leave, I shall take it.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Take it then, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That man at the door won’t let me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Knock him down. It will be one way of
surmounting the difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is such an elephant. I disliked him the
very first time I saw him,” she replied with energy,
and as much simplicity as the truth occasioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, go away and fight it out with him; watch
the door, and bounce out when he’s not looking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t do anything so undignified. I shall
make friends with the kitchen people, and creep out
that way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The kitchen door leads into the garden, and
the walls are high, and the gate is locked. I keep
the key myself, to ensure no one getting to the
stables.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then give me leave to go out at the front.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, why should you want to go out at the
front? You have as beautiful a home as you
could possibly wish for. What more can you want?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fresh air and human beings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have them here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head. The tears rose in her throat,
and were very hard to choke down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the dismallest place I ever came to; and
I’m no use. The people here always contradict me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are the first person who has ever complained
of them; and your opinion goes for nothing, your
own conduct leaves so much to be desired.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In my time I have experienced much ingratitude,
but never any quite to equal yours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—ungrateful?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most decidedly!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“What are you wanting from me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quiet submission.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s eyes opened wide, her lips parted; her
expression was one of unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To do what you’re told quietly. Now you <em>know</em>,
there is no excuse for your not complying.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But to submit means to stay here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I can’t. Oh, I can’t really! Anything but
that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing but that. You come to me with the
most unusual request, and I am fool enough to put
myself out of the way for you. Then you expect
to go away, or rather slip away, without any more
words about repayment. And when you are brought
back, all this squalling.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nice people are quite content with ‘Thank you.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not nice, and ‘Thank you’ never appeals to
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But if I stay here I can do nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, you can mope.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In return for a tongue?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not? It would be the height of self-sacrifice,
and the perfection of thanksgiving.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her serious eyes met his thoughtfully. “Do you
really wish me to stay here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I not only wish, but am determined on it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then my self-sacrifice can never be spontaneous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean you are changing your mind. You
are wishful to stop?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not wishful, but if you want it, I’ll—I’ll try to
settle down more cheerfully. After all, it’s only just.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is so.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Shall I often see you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never. I am not fond of inflictions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He spoke so drily, and the words were so unkind,
that Rosalie’s wistful face grew paler. Yet still she
argued to herself it would be selfish to wish to be
free, to have a tongue and everything. And after
all, the stranger was so clever that he must of
necessity know best.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you let me out just for an hour?” she asked
at length, with a voice greatly subdued from the
first clamorous outburst.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not for an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I have an aunt, and she is dead. I shouldn’t
like strangers to take what once belonged to her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is your uncle?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is dead too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your people?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have none.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where then, in the name of all the devils in
Lucifram, do you intend to go to?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought when people knew I had miraculously
come by a tongue they would—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! I thought as much. You want to behave
with all the absurdity of a hen that has laid an egg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed!” said Rosalie, flushing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You want to get out just to cackle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She was silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You admit it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I admit nothing but your want of manners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a waspish, vinegarish tongue yours is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the fault of the doctor, then. If one cannot
produce a sweet instrument one might as well admit
oneself a failure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How was I to tell? Your face was so deceptive.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Maybe so is my tongue. I was only speaking
in fun. Let me out for one hour. Lend me twopence,
and I will return, having spoken to no one,
and in the right frame for being submissive.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a short time he was silent. At last he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Promise me faithfully you will return.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I promise you most faithfully.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Within the hour?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You understand perfectly that my reason for
bringing you back is not for any personal gratification
I should derive from it. It is simply so that
you may not obtain any great or particular pleasure
from having a prayer perfected.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You speak plainly enough for the dullest mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m glad. Now you may go. And remember,
come back if you have any sense of gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So Rosalie passed out again into the farther hall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have permission to pass,” said she at the door,
and then she stood outside.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed to her when she reached the parapet
that she had been out of the world for years. And
oh! to be back in the world again! To see and
hear the sights and sounds, so commonplace and
ordinary, yet to her stilled ear so sweet again.
Never had that terrible silent mansion struck her
as so terrible till now she stood amongst the noise
of work and life once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>One hour of freedom. One hour with the light,
jogging world, and then to pass once more beneath
the shadow—a silent spirit in a silent world. The
’bus rattled on, taking its own slow time towards that
quarter of the city where she had lived. She found
the upper storey empty, and none had missed her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Yesterday the doctor had told her his intention of
coming for her at four o’clock to-day. It was not
yet quite twelve.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each of the little rooms was now quite bare, except
the tiny attic called her bedroom. In it were gathered
the few trivial things she prized as belonging to days
that were less dark than these. There was a necklace
of coral, a collar of lace, a pair of gloves, kid,
backed with astrachan, the last present her uncle
ever gave her; a tiny brooch of gold, left by her
aunt, and always worn by her, and but little else.
One other thing she found, a book that in that planet
compares nearly to our Bible. Sadly and lovingly
she placed them all together, and kissed them many
times, her eyes blinded with tears; and then a voice
whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why go back? Go to this doctor. Tell him
everything, for he is kind. None would blame you
for not returning to that prison mansion, even though
under a promise. It was an unfair advantage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must go back, because I promised. I asked
everything in return for nothing. And God, in His
own good time, will make the dark path plain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The struggle gradually died, and Right conquered.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last she was ready to go. Glancing round for
the last time, she saw upon the mantelpiece a key,
a solitary one upon an iron ring.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It belonged to uncle’s safe, the one that had so
little in it,” she thought. She took it up. Its dull
appearance suggested so much dull tragedy to her.
“I’ll take it with me,” she thought, and slipped it
in the pocket of her dress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she passed down the broad stone steps out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>once more into the street. Her brief holiday was
over. The short hour was almost passed. She
clenched her hands together, and drove back the
blinding tears that struggled in her eyes. Gradually
she drew nearer to the Avenue—how eagerly she had
rushed there on the night before! The great black
marble mansion came in view, its dusky grandeur
having a certain sinister lowering to her understanding
eye no different from a prison.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder when I’ll walk along this street again?”
she thought, and ascended the marble steps, hiding
all trace of past emotion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>“The master wished to speak to you when you
returned,” the attendant at the door said to her when
he answered it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie crossed the hall, feeling that vague sense
of satisfaction that generally accompanies honesty,
and which at times appears so poor a recompense.</p>

<p class='c004'>This time on knocking she waited for the answer.
When it came she opened the door and entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt was in the act of filing papers,
and generally tidying up the littered table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are quite punctual,” said he. “And what is
more, astoundingly honest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You did not expect I should return, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No! Honestly speaking, I thought I had seen
the last of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gratitude brought me back at the expense of
inclination.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should have yielded to temptation, and run
away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps my action in returning was not quite so
commendable as you think. I was much tempted to
run away, and then—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I could find no place to go to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have no appreciative friends?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Not one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The doctor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked up quickly, and flushed. “Why
do you speak of him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sure I don’t know,” he answered drily; “I
believe I was meaning myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh—yes—of course,” stammered Rosalie. “I
thought you meant Dr. Kaye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you had notions of appealing to him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed. “You are not the pleasantest of
companions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You might as well make a confidant of me. I
am the only one you will find for some time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, yes, then,” she answered, looking across at
him with a timid glance. “I thought of running
to the doctor, informing him you intended making
a prisoner of me in a free city, and asking him to
give me the benefit of his protection and advice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you thought better of it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You told me if I was grateful I should return.
I was grateful, and though there seems something
very topsy-turvy about the recompense you ask
for, there is something in it that appeals to my
sense of justice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is why you came back?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no other reason.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt all this time had been sitting
in his chair by the table. Rosalie was standing
at the farther side of it. Now he got up and walked
over to the fireplace, where the fire was burning
brightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie Paleaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Brought up by an aunt and uncle?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Always dumb, and therefore very much out of
the world?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you learn the little bit of knowledge
you possess?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I listened to it. I was not deaf, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could you read?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I can read. That is how I used to spend
most of my time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Travels, novels, or biography?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A little bit of both—all three, I mean. ‘The
Life of Krimjo on the Desert Island,’ which was my
favourite, contained a little of all, I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ally Krimjo was only make-belief,” said he
ruthlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed he wasn’t! He had gone through everything
he spoke about, the shipwreck and the
loneliness, the savages and everything. Make-belief!
Oh, Mr. Barringcourt, have you ever really
read it through?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, at the time it was written.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Rosalie laughed again triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That shows you don’t know the book I’m talking
about at all. The man who wrote it lived hundreds
of years ago. Quite three hundred, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At that rate I must be mistaken. Then if you
are so fond of travel and biography, I have some
volumes here all on that subject, written, too, about
the time you speak of. You will have a great deal
of time lie heavy on your hands; perhaps you would
like some?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked dubious, and her eyes travelled to
the imposing-looking book-shelves.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“I never found anyone quite to come up to Ally
Krimjo,” she replied regretfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You refuse my offer?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not if you give me something interesting. But
as a rule I don’t like biographies, because the people
always die. Now, Ally Krimjo—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re quite right,” said Mr. Barringcourt grimly.
“Ally Krimjo hasn’t died, so he deserves to live.
Have you the Book of Divine Inspiration?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes! I don’t suppose there’s anyone without
that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s one with pictures; look at it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took down from a shelf a heavy and ponderous
volume of the Book of Divine Inspiration, as
written and compiled in the planet Lucifram, and
carried it without the least apparent effort to the
table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now come and look at the pictures. I’ll show
you a few, and then you can take it away with you
and look at the rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He opened it at the first page—the frontispiece.
It was a picture of the Golden Serpent, so lifelike
that its appearance was most startling. The book,
likewise, must have possessed the property of magnifying
all contained in it, for suddenly the head and
coils and tails seemed to enlarge to the same gigantic
size as that within the temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like it. Don’t show me any more of that
book,” Rosalie said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why?” he asked, with apparent surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I don’t know,” she answered, almost
whispering. “It’s the Serpent. I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you are the young lady who was kissing its
head, and throwing your arms around it.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Yes, I know. That was because I did not
understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, now! I think it’s cruel and deceitful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s nothing short of blasphemy. The Serpent
is a god!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you believe that?” she asked, suddenly
looking up, and fixing his eyes with a look as keen
as it was serious.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two pairs of eyes, dark and light, each encountered
one another—each trying to read the other’s secret—and
both for once inscrutable, dark and light alike.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I’ve got a pretty good mental digestion;
it can take most things,” he said, the corners of his
mouth curving into a smile. “Look! Miss—Miss—What’s
your name, by the way?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My name is Rosalie—Rosalie Paleaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well now, Miss Paleaf, let us turn to the second
picture.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Reluctantly she turned round once more, to behold
a forest jungle, as fine and beautiful a scene as one
could wish. Its size and realism made her put out
her hand to pull a twig of feathery foliage, when
suddenly she was startled to see beneath it a pair of
eyes, wild and yet intelligent, gleaming out at her.
It was an animal shaped and sized much like a
monkey. Behind it was another of the same kind,
a partner in its joys and sorrows evidently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie sprang back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at that hideous thing!” she cried in horror,
pointing to it. Then recollecting herself, she said,
with an effort at more self-control and appreciation:
“Are—are they extinct now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. What would <em>you</em> say?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I sincerely hope so, I’m sure. Put it away.
There is something uncanny about that book. That
creature startled me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s an acquired taste. Here we come to another.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had turned onward to a third picture, in which
was shown a woman sitting on the roots of a tree,
the expression of her face long and uncompromising,
full of discontent. She wore no clothing, but her long
and silky hair was sufficient covering. She was of
no particular beauty, and her expression of discontent,
mingled with curiosity, subtly introduced, and having
little intelligence to enlighten it, gave the girl a
feeling of repugnance. In one hand she held a fruit
of brilliant scarlet; a mouthful was being eaten, and
its taste did not seem altogether to her liking.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think of this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I like it very little better. The man who painted
it, judging from her face, understood human nature,
and had very little mercy for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There you are mistaken. It is a caricature,” he
answered softly, “painted one day by a man, and
sent to his dearest friend—a woman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But she is eating a tomato.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course! Let us continue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The next picture showed this same woman standing
beside a man who sat upon a rock cracking nuts with
his teeth. As Rosalie looked the scenes began to
move and become lifelike, pretty much in the same
way as a cinematograph. At first the man did not
perceive his companion, but turning suddenly, in the
act of taking a broken shell from his mouth, he saw
her holding the scarlet fruit, from which she had
taken no more than two fair mouthfuls. On seeing
this his jaw dropped, his eyes expanded.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Thin, far-away voices came from the picture, aiding
the illusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What for did you that?” said he, in a voice
devoid of beauty and expression.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To find out,” she replied, in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we die—we die—if we eat fruit of blood
colour!” he cried, with superstitious horror in his
voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We no die, we live and grow fat. I eat, I live;
but I miss something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know not. Eat, and tell me.” Her look was
cunning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I dare not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is the best of all kinds—but for one thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what is dat?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eat, and tell me. You be my faithful love.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gingerly he took it in his hand, applied it
reluctantly to his lips, sucking the juice alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wants—”</p>

<p class='c004'>His low forehead wrinkled. He could not
formulate his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wants—”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then all round a million voices echoed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>It wants but salt!</em>”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Salt!” he shouted, drowning the harmonic voices
in his new discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hereupon the woman fell upon her knees, and
almost worshipped him, kissing his hands and feet,
weeping tears of pleasure on them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Scrape me some up,” he uttered, taking advantage
of her low position.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did it with her finger-nails.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Now stand back whilst I eat it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I—I found it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stand back, goose, and watch me eat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I found it first,” she whimpered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s a seed—that’s all you’re worth,” he
answered. “Now I go to find more,” said he,
jumping up valiantly. “You bake bread and get
me butter for when I return.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I come too!” she cried. “You eat the whole
while I worky work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fool—toad—weasel—monkey! bake me the
bread, or I your neck am breaking!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And with that they disappeared from the page.
Only the picture in its first stage remained visible.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s not pretty at all,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Few things are in real life,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that was caricature.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not in the way you think. It was caricature, I
grant, but with a difference.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I don’t think the eating of salt with tomato
could make a man really superior, do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; but it was the fact that he discovered salt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he didn’t. He was as ignorant as she till
the voices whispered it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nevertheless, he caught the first sound.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, of course,” said Rosalie thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Mr. Barringcourt laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You do not appreciate its true absurdity,” he
said; “but that, maybe, is scarcely necessary. Now,
that picture, or series of pictures, was painted by a
woman, and sent to the man who had sent her the
first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how about the voices?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! she was no ordinary woman, by any means.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Was she quarrelling with the man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. They were amusing each other in wet
weather.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They paint most beautiful scenery, but I don’t
like their men and women.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not intended to. Now, shall we
go on?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I’d rather not, really. It gives me headache,
and I’ve had it ever since yesterday afternoon, except
for that little bit after you had healed me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are tired of the Book of Divine Inspiration?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m tired of the pictures; they are no better
than caricatures and skits. I don’t think that’s a
good book to keep in a house at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You astound me! Were you not brought up to
worship the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but the Serpent disappointed me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see. You only worship a God who is content
to spoil you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” she said. “Perhaps I’ll settle
down again before long.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope so. Has it ever struck you, Miss Paleaf,
how completely you are in my power?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she answered, looking at him quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you know, I found you in the temple, in
the Holiest Place—the place forbidden to women.
Do you know what the punishment for that
transgression is?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To have your tongue torn out by the roots.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not in the least. In this one interview with
me you have said enough against the Serpent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>set all its scales and coils bristling, and its fangs
working.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have said nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Cruel and deceitful,’ were not those your words?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but to tear my tongue out would not be to
prove it otherwise. The Serpent’s wisdom should
assert itself and prove the opposite. You were also
in the Holiest Place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course; but for a man the offence is not so
capital.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tomatoes and salt,” said Rosalie, and she
laughed. He laughed also.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your impudence is only beaten by your
ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As often as I offend solely with my tongue, you
must take the blame yourself. I think you must
have oiled the wheels too freely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a good thing you have no relatives, Miss
Paleaf; they would have missed you, disappearing
so suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Under the circumstances, I suppose it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were you happy with them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes! As happy as the day, when we were
in prosperity. But this last year has been nothing
but shadow and poverty, and I don’t think I ever
realised how many things I had to be thankful for
till they were all gone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The gift of speech does not compensate for all
things, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. I have had it so short a time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are longing for freedom, and can find
nothing to compensate for the bitterness of its
loss. Is not that it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think it is only that. My aunt was only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>buried the day before yesterday. I should be very
callous and ungrateful if I could forget her so readily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yet you cannot deny the events of the past
day have put a great gulf betwixt you and her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I could think she had died a year ago
along with uncle. Poor thing! It would have been
so much better if she had done so, I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long do you think your term of
imprisonment will last?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. The future has always been a
blank to me. I never built those castles in the air
that many love to build.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about your prayer to find a tongue?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. I longed to speak, but never
looked into a future crowned by successful prayer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, your term of imprisonment here lasts
three years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a long time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the contrary, reckoned justly, a very short
one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean by ‘reckoned justly’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took up a bundle of filed papers from the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These are accounts of long standing,” he answered
gravely. “It is strange how quickly a high rate of
interest accumulates. What you wipe off in three
years or less by ready payments, some are leaving
till a future date, till it accumulates and doubles,
then maybe trebles, and some day swamps them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s eyes opened with unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But whom is the money owed to?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you all those debtors?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“These are a few—a very few. People find out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the softness of my heart, and then they come to me.
Women with stingy husbands and extravagant tastes,
men with limited brains and boundless ambition.
Each and all, with many other pleas and reasons,
call upon me and win me over to their way of
thinking. I am always won. No simple-hearted
fool within the country gives in more easily than
I when I can gain security of person.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But don’t you tell them that you expect return?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I like them to think there’s one generous
person in the world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that is scarcely fair. You ought to tell
them what you want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The argument would be beyond them. Besides,
it would come then too much like making bargains.
I am no shopman. Those who seek me find me.
Others stay away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But this is nothing short of madness. How can
you make people pay without a signature or
anything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never jest but when it suits my purpose. And
for madness, I grant upon the surface it may appear
as such. But each bill works backward—item by
item, year by year. Mathematicians and philosophers
looking through them would find a subject
more than fascinating.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But if when you show your bill the people refuse
to pay, and say they never got the goods?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then, one little snip and the fabric ravels
out again, loop by loop, as it was knitted up. Back
it goes to the fundamental working, as rigid as
machinery, as true as time, and ends in nothingness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie was silent for a time, and then she said:
“Is that how it is you are such a rich man?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>But he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am poorer than many people think,” he answered.
“And richer too—wealth is comparative. But now,”
he continued, with more energy, “I have come to the
conclusion that your term of prison life shall not be
quite so dull as you expected. You may come to me
at any time, provided I have leisure. Moreover, you
may borrow any book; amongst all these there will
be surely some to suit you, even though it be but a
uniquely pictured book of Ally Krimjo.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what are you expecting in return? You say
you like people to esteem you generous, and are not
in reality so at all. This generosity to me may end
in nothing but a high percentage. It may bring me
down to nothingness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have the advantage of being young, you see.
I might end your debtor if I tied you up in an
unsympathetic prison, and let you out at last, to find
I was too late, and your spirit killed by solitude.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was looking at her with a puzzled and
thoughtful expression, as if trying to weigh or settle
something in his mind to his own satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think you were easier to understand dumb than
you are speaking,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, yes, because I would be less complex,” said
Rosalie wisely. “I was minus something before,
now I’m not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe. When will you come to visit me again?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow morning, if I may. From twelve to
one?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. We’ll arrange for that hour twice a week.
It will be neither too long nor too often to bore either
of us. The rest of the time you’ll spend as best you
can within the house and gardens.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>MARIANA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Rosalie went away again, upstairs to that corridor
on which the rooms in which she lived were situated.
Another meal was there in readiness, for the hour
was now past one. She ate with little heart, the
silent attendant by her side unwittingly depressing
her. When the meal was over she went to a little
sitting-room which Mariana had shown her, taking
her small parcel of belongings with her, and shut the
door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here a fire was burning, the only one in that
particular wing, for they seemed to be chary of fires
here. The room had little of brightness about it
otherwise. Its walls were panelled oak without
design or ornament. An oaken table on three legs,
a few high-backed chairs, a rug before the fireplace,
polished boards the floor; that was all. A narrow
window looked out upon the blank wall opposite,
giving the room a gloomy, darkened look. Yet there
was something about this simply furnished room that
Rosalie liked. It was less luxurious than any other
in that house which she had visited.</p>

<p class='c004'>She drew one of the high-backed chairs toward the
fire, and sat down, her feet upon the fender. She
had taken her small Book of Divine Inspiration from
the parcel, and sat holding it idly in her hands,
staring at the flames. After all, it was comforting to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>be able to hold something, something familiar and
not strange, something that had been handled and
read by loving hands and eyes, though now they
were passed away for ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>For Rosalie, despite her behaviour downstairs, was
only playing a part. Laughing or answering, there
had been ever in her heart the Serpent’s tooth. It
gnawed and stung with almost unendurable pain.
O God! to be but rid of it for five sweet minutes.</p>

<p class='c004'>So far as Rosalie was concerned, there were no
late dinners in this house of mystery. She had
ordinary tea at five o’clock, and then the lights for
the evening were brought in, and the red curtains
drawn. About seven Mariana knocked at the door,
and entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is my evening for playing,” said she quietly;
“would you care to come and listen to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you; I should like to come very much.
What do you play?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Play? Oh! I always play on a violin; it’s my
favourite amusement. It’s the way I always spend
my night out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Night out,” thought Rosalie; “what an expression
coming from her lips!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Aloud she said: “I’m very fond of music. Have
you learnt long?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t remember learning, but I suppose I must
have done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She led the way along the corridor, down the
slippery stairs, and turned in at the glass door
leading from the central hall towards Mr. Barringcourt’s
study; but she did not go there. Instead,
she paused at a door next to it on the same side.
She passed in, and held the door for Rosalie to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>follow. The room within was dark, but it must have
overlooked the Avenue, for lights from the outside
shone weirdly in through the long windows, lighting
up short lines of furniture, half a grand piano, a
strip of table, an ottoman, and a piece of wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana turned on one light. It was soft and
shaded, but had not strength enough to illuminate
the whole room. The farther corners were entirely
in the shade.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you not turn on more lights?” asked Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I like the twilight best. I can think and
feel better when the light is low.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she uncased the violin which she had brought
down with her, and tried the strings, testing them
by the piano, which was now a little better brought
to view.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie went over to a window—it was the natural
instinct of a prisoner—and looked out of it with
hungry eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Passing, passing, never ceasing, went the traffic,
and through the closed windows came the muffled
sound of horses’ feet, and wheels, and voices.
Feverishly she scanned each face as closely as she
could in the distance; but she read nothing on
them but what one reads on a hundred faces every
day. Her heart beat with an aching longing to
touch the pavement again with free feet. Three
years! It was a lifetime. One day in a house
like this contained an agony of years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am impatient,” she said, and closed her lips
patiently and tight.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had forgotten Mariana’s music—in the testing
of the chords—till suddenly, after a short pause, she
began to play.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Rosalie’s attention was first divided between the
music and the street. What was played seemed to
fit in with her mood—a simple air of sadness. But
this harmonic accompaniment had its dangers, for
by degrees Rosalie felt her spirits, instead of keeping
pace with it, begin to follow. Then the street
claimed her attention less, the music absorbing it.
And at last she turned round reluctantly and looked
toward the player. Mariana, never an ordinary-looking
woman, was by the one pale light quite
extraordinary. The long graceful robe she wore
made her look more than commonly tall. Her
pretty arms, white and delicate yet, full of a certain
indefinable strength, and the ivory whiteness of her
face, had a curious charm and fascination in the
dim lights. But beside her playing, the musician
herself was insignificant. From sadness her notes
changed to melancholy, from melancholy on to
misery, from misery to despair. Despondency,
tragedy, hopeless complaint, and restless, weary
wandering on those spiritual wastes where no light
comes, or even narrow track to show that ever
pilgrim passed before—this was her music.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her face as she played betrayed no great emotion.
The brightness in her eyes spoke more of mental
activity and retrospection than of sentiment. Gradually
the listener’s eyes fell on the furniture around.
Much of it, in conjunction with the rest of the house,
was of polished oak, carved finely and curiously.
Opposite there was a cabinet museum about the
height of a man, and above it the carved head of
some idolater’s god, growing in clearness as she
became accustomed to the light</p>

<p class='c004'>But surely the music had affected it. Its ugly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>eyes, protruding and rid of all intelligence, altered
slowly to expression almost human. For every
quivering note struck from the violin found a resting-place
within these staring orbs, filling them both with
misery. Their dumb speech was terrible, but when
Rosalie moved away, more ghastly still by reason
of their persistence. She looked away. There on
the floor beside her was a tiger-skin, a rug of worth
and beauty, with a head and glassy eyes. Its eyes
met hers. Their dumb misery told a tale beyond the
power of speech. Shivering, she turned and moved
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>When would Mariana stop and take her from this
wretched room? She had moved within range of
the statues, those dim, misty forms of whiteness
which rose like ghosts with out and upstretched arms
to beckon her. Faces of cold, white, and deathly
beauty, and eyes! Oh, terrible! all gazing into hers
with that sad gaze and straining misery, reaching to
the height and depth of agony.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was enough. Had they but wailed, or cried, or
uttered sound, the spell had broken. But here was
silence—ghastly, terrible, because so secret and so
unexpected.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the tension reached a limit. On all sides
Rosalie encountered ghastly faces of long-suffering
pain to which the music seemed to form a fitting
background. Turning hurriedly to escape one face
belonging to a child, set in a picture hung upon the
wall, her glance fell by chance upon the mirror and
revealed herself, strained horror in her eyes, with
blanched cheeks and open lips. She scarcely recognised
who stood there. It was enough. She crossed
the room half running, and clutched Mariana’s arm.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“How much longer?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The time is up. Alas! how quickly it has passed.
Never again till next week, and then but two short
hours. And yet you ask me, ‘How much longer?’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can you play like that, and never feel it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the only time I ever feel, the only time I ever
live.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it is pain and sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better than emptiness. Now I have lost the only
thing I love. All week it lies quite mute, a thing of
idleness, bursting with life. And when I take it up
it utters so long a wail, so sad a sigh, that my heart
returns to it, and we weep together till pain becomes
an ecstasy and sadness joy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Mariana! what a life is yours!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No different from the rest. A life of grey
to-morrows that come and go in endless twilight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you feel like this to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. To-morrow brings a calm existence.
To-night I fill my heart with tears.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was it brought you here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I loved not wisely, but too well, this little
fiddle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And has it brought you to this pass?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, if pass you call it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, Mariana, give it up!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For her the dimness of the room had vanished,
its fantasies and ghostly shadows thrown off with
one great effort. She grasped the other’s arms in
both her hands, and stared at her, taller by her
sudden force and fierceness. The other looked at
her, and then recoiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give it up! The only joy of life—the only life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>beyond a dull existence! Why, I should die—the
very thought would kill me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No! It would make you live!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Mariana only looked at her, and shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie, can I play? Can you make anything
out of it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never heard such music; but it is wrong—it’s
the wrong sort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Mariana came close up to her, just as before
she had drawn back, and, with a sudden weakness,
drooped her head upon the other’s shoulder, clasping
her hands about her waist.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t say that!” she cried, her voice little above
a whisper. “I cannot bear it. I can do nothing
more. There is no time. Once or twice I asked the
Master would he listen, and he did. But he said
there was no tune in what I played, no harmony
of any sort—that all was a delusion, a fancy of my
brain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that was not the truth.” And Rosalie held
her very tight, that woman who in the morning had
seemed so strong to her. “And he only said it
because he knew you would be fool enough to take
it all to heart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hush! hush! It’s treason to talk like that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing’s treason but failure. You follow my
advice, and give up the fiddle. Then after a while
you’ll get it back again in such a way that even Mr.
Barringcourt will not be able to say there’s no tune
in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana looked at her, with surprise and misunderstanding
on every feature.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t give it up. I’m bound to play for two
hours every Wednesday night, harmony or discord.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Why bound?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was the stipulation I made when first I came
here. It’s the kind of thing one can’t break through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t want to?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I don’t; but if I did I could not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You would rather live for two hours a week than
seven times twenty-four?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, and never will.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Mr. Barringcourt’s voice, and he spoke from
the door, through which he had entered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>A CONVERSATION IN SHADOWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Mr. Barringcourt was in it, the great black
house held its mysteries and shadows; without him
they seemed aggravated fourfold. Not long after
the Wednesday evening music, Rosalie stood in the
centre of the hall suddenly smitten with the most
chilly fear she had ever experienced in her life. No
noise, no sound, not even the wind without, penetrated
those walls of iron marble. Shadows and
silence in endless vista met her eye. Shadows
and silence like a sigh congealed, changed from
nothingness into reality.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dreading the loneliness, and her own want of nerve
to go upstairs, she went to the door and accosted the
keeper there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does this house frighten you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all,” he answered, most politely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is strange, because I feel most frightened
here. It is not haunted, is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are no—no ghosts?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled. “That depends upon your imagination,
I should say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to go upstairs, and I dare not. You don’t
think me very foolish, do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is Mariana? Does she not look after
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Yes. But she went away, nearly an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall I call her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, please do!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He touched a bell, and a minute later Mariana
appeared coming down the staircase. She looked as
calm as ever. The short outburst of the evening
had died away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sorry to trouble you. But I really could not
come upstairs alone. The house was so quiet that it
frightened me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will get accustomed to the silence by
degrees,” she answered, and led the way towards the
staircase.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they reached the little sitting-room where
the fire burnt, Rosalie was pleased to find a white
cloth laid there, with supper on it. It was a very
plain repast, but cheerful, possibly because of the
bright lamp and firelight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When do you have your supper?” she asked of
Mariana.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have had mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is the time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Almost ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How late! That is the time I generally go to
bed. What time do you go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As soon as you are settled for the night I shall
retire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where do you sleep?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the next room to yours. If you want anything
in the night, you may ring or come to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But then I should have to come out on to the
corridor. I hate corridors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. My bedroom opens into yours. Your door
that opens into the passage is locked at night.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“By whom?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you lock it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. You are safer with it
locked, I expect.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long have you lived here, Mariana?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three years this autumn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And how long has Mr. Barringcourt been here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same length of time. I came with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you are happy here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I could not be happier—under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were you ever happier?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think I was once. But it is a very long time
ago. I don’t remember how long, so that it cannot
really matter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you live before you lived here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t quite remember. I think it was a very
cold and dark place, and one day Mr. Barringcourt
came and asked me would I like to go away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you accepted?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I wanted to get warm again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And are you warm?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Every Wednesday night. If it were not
for that I should grow cold again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A silence. Then:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who lived here before Mr. Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A man who died. His name was Geoffrey
Todbrook.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Geoffrey Todbrook.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, he’s the man who started homes for
incurables. There was one for the dumb and deaf
and blind. I should have gone there.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“I have heard he was very charitable. He left
this house to Mr. Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were they related?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I rather think myself the Master had let it
to him on a lease. Then when the lease expired he
died, and left a will to smooth all difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was Mr. Barringcourt living in the city before
Mr. Todbrook’s death?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! I don’t think he had ever been here
before. He took me to the opera one Wednesday
night, and he said it was only the second time he
had been there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The opera? Did you like it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I liked it; but it made my head ache. I
was trying to remember something all the time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you often go out with him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no; that would be to get oneself talked
about. Besides, so long as we remain here, I am but
a servant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why does Mr. Barringcourt keep me here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I expect you have some secret he wishes to
discover, otherwise he would not trouble himself
about you. When he took me to the opera it was
to discover something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then how can you tell?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because, up to the time we went, and through
the performance, he was very affable to me. Afterwards
he took no more notice of me, and never has
done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you hate him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why should I? I had no secret. His conduct
was permissible; and I had rather be left alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“And what secret can I have that he should be
agreeable to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I cannot tell. Perhaps, like me, you have none.
But if you have, rest assured you will not leave this
house till it has been discovered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you ever had anyone staying here before
in the same way that I am?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not in my time. People with secrets worth
knowing are few and far between.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then what can make the Master think such an
insignificant person as I could hold a secret?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I cannot tell. I only said it might be so; there
is no other reason why he should tolerate your
company?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed, despite a very uneasy feeling in
her mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you ever have company here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Last Christmas there was a ball, and we
had two or three dinner parties and entertainments.
Lady Flamington generally acts as hostess. She and
Sir James are very friendly with Mr. Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is she like?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very beautiful, I think, with very pleasing
manners. She must be so to please the Master; he
is so hard to please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps she has a secret?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no; I hardly think so. He makes a convenience
of her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good gracious!” and Rosalie laughed. “You
don’t give him an enviable character.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I speak as truthfully as my perceptions allow
me; but at times I may be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And does she not resent being made a convenience
of?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“No; it is only self-respect that keeps her from
falling in love with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he then so agreeable to her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He gives her everything that is not worth the
having.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He gives her everything but love.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that, with a husband, no one would want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana’s eyebrows rose. “There are double
marriages on Lucifram, I’m given to understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but no one thinks much of a woman who
marries twice, unless she is a widow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed,” Mariana answered, and was silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But is Mr. Barringcourt fond of no one?” Rosalie
pursued.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never heard of anyone. He is cold and proud,
and often takes no trouble to hide it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But then there are so many good and beautiful
women in the world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They find partners, perhaps, that need them more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After another silence Rosalie continued: “And
Mr. Todbrook—what did he die of?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think he went down the back staircase.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In his own house?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He died.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In which room?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The one the Master sleeps in now. There is a
portrait of him in the picture-gallery. To-morrow
you shall see it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did he die of?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He had quick ears. He heard the spirit voices
calling, and he went to them.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Painlessly?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Like one sailing on a sea of glass. They say his
end was merciful; and I know it was. He suffered
nothing—he suffers nothing now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he in heaven?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I doubt there was too little pain for that; but
yet I cannot tell. He may have suffered previously.
Men’s lives are strange. And the roughest rocks
are coated by smooth waters. They keep their
secrets all too well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m tired, Mariana. Shall we go to bed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. When you wish it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So they rose and went together to the bedroom,
which had a chilly air in it after the cosy room.
When at last Rosalie was in bed, Mariana smoothed
the coverlet and tucked the bed-clothes in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Leave me a light, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I’ll put it on this table. But there is
nothing to fear. An easy conscience may sleep
well here, secure from harm.” She moved away, but
after a few steps returned. She stooped over the
bed and kissed Rosalie’s brow. “Good-night, little
one. Sleep peacefully till daybreak.” And then
she went away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Big tears rose in Rosalie’s eyes, for the words
had awakened in her a terrible longing for love
and companionship, stronger and more powerful
than ever Mariana, in her terribly set existence,
could ever know how to give. For Rosalie felt that
she was even now the stronger of the two, and wept
for Mariana’s solitude as well as her own.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>GARDEN AND HOUSE OF SHADOWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The next morning the sensation of waking in such
fine surroundings had lost all its charm. Rosalie
awoke with a dull leaden pain at her heart, that
gained rather than lost power as she recalled one
by one the articles of furniture in this new home.
The long mirror had lost its fascination; so had the
silken bed-hangings. She did not jump out of bed,
but rather lay there idly, with no wish to rise;
oppressed with such a heaviness that to lie still
seemed the only ease from all those aches and
pains that twine around a heavy heart. As the
grey light of early morning brightened and
broadened, she curled in among the bed-clothes,
and shut her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only they would let me lie here, and not
disturb me! I would never disturb them, I’m sure.
I feel so weary that the least exertion is the biggest
effort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she lay very still for a long time, till at last
Mariana knocked at the door and opened it, bringing
the customary cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I feel so tired, Mariana,” Rosalie said, “and
there’s nothing to do. Don’t you think I might
spend the day in bed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is against the rules.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who makes all the rules here?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“The Master.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he has gone away till to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That does not excuse us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he would never know unless you told. I
am tired, really, Mariana. I could just lie still, and
never move an inch all day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must get up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When I get up my heart aches.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That does not enter into the consideration of the
rule. You must get up, or you will be shaken out
when the bed is made.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So very reluctantly Rosalie rose, with a day of
nothingness and imprisonment before her. She was
dressed in about the same time as yesterday, had
breakfast served in the same room in the same way,
and then walked out on to the corridor aimlessly and
disconsolately.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana had disappeared. Although Rosalie tried
every door along the corridor she could not find her.
Many of these were locked, and others she discovered
to be bedrooms, furnished much as her own, with the
exception of the little sitting-room and the room in
which she had her meals.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last, weary of this, she passed out to the high
gallery overreaching the square central hall. She
walked round it, and tried various doors leading off
from it, but all were locked. Below, the dim hall lay
in silence. Nothing of light or life was there, though
it was not yet mid-day. She looked down over the
high oaken balustrade, and sighed, and the echo
brought her sigh back to her. She whispered
“Rosalie”; the word ran round the arching dome,
and then returned—a mocking, hollow voice within
the silence. So the morning crept away, with no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>brightness to speed its dragging hours, no companionship,
no occupation. Not a sound fell on her
ear. So still was everything, the house might have
been a City of the Dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>At dinner-time she ate mechanically the food they
placed before her. To refuse was simply to raise up
insistence. Then she withdrew to the little sitting-room,
to idle away what time would go, to find after
endless waiting that scarcely an hour had passed.
Then she got up and went back to the bedroom to
bring her hat, and with the same difficulty as the day
before, reached with safety the foot of the spiral
staircase.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doorkeeper was sitting not far away from it,
reading a paper. She went towards him, and as she
approached him he looked up, and then rose from his
seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you mind telling me which way I should
go to find the garden?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly. If you will come this way I will take
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie smiled sadly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose somebody got out or in whilst you are
away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one would wish to go out, and the door only
opens from within,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked across the hall, and she followed him
to the glass door behind the staircase. This door
likewise entered upon a corridor with doors leading
from either side of it. The house seemed all doors,
but at the farther end a spacious fernery opened out,
the curtains (of deep red) which shut it off being now
looped and drawn back, so that much beyond was
visible. Through the magnificent fern-house he led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>her till they came to a door of glass leading down
into the garden beyond.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doorkeeper opened it, and let her pass through,
himself following.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside, broad flights of steps descended by
terraces to a lawn of smoothest grass. The terraces
were paved in large squares of black and white
marble, and from the central one a huge fountain was
sending up showers of sparkling water to meet the
brilliant sun. Beds of flowers, all of colours resembling
scarlet geraniums, were laid out bordering the
side walks. One magnificent bed of what looked like
crimson gladioli ran up a steep bank bordering the
left-hand wall. The high walls themselves were
covered with creepers, all of brilliant red, just as
autumn leaves are often found, and the only relief
afforded was that of the dark foliage of the trees that
clustered willow fashion in the rear portion of the
garden. This was a kind of wooded avenue along
which a carriage drive led from the big gates in the
outer wall round to those stables where the Master’s
favourite horses were.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the garden,” said her companion, when he
had brought her so far; “you will return any time
before five. After that the doors are locked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Rosalie was left alone she walked across the
lawn slowly, taking in all the beauty and striking nature
of the scene. The gardens were large. The avenue
and shrubbery beyond were shaded, and provided
with many rustic and artistic seats. Rosalie walked
along the carriage drive as far as she could, and then
a sudden and unaccountable gloom seemed to fall
upon her and all things. Just then a sudden bend in
the road brought her full in view of the stables. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>seemed to her for one instant as if against the gloom
surrounding her they shone out in flashing whiteness.
They were flat-roofed, though high, and the strong
pillars supporting and ornamenting the building were
an exact fac-simile of those used in the decoration of
the temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>And standing there looking at it, Rosalie smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder whose idea that was?” she thought.
“A devout architect and designer would never have
thought of such a thing. But perhaps I’m mistaken;
this may be a private place of worship. I’ll go on
and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So she advanced as far as the building; but
whether it were stable or chapel she could not tell,
for it possessed no doorway. She walked around it
as far as she could on either side, till prevented by a
wall of great height, but found nothing to serve as
a clue as to the nature of its use. No sound came
from within—none of the odour that generally
characterises such places, either of sanctity or horses—and
for the third time Rosalie walked round with
growing curiosity. Marble, marble, all was marble,
cold and hard and lifeless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I really think granite would be a welcome
change,” she said, and sighed and walked away.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was really pleasant and enjoyable to be
in the open air. To be able to look up at a sky
that belonged in common to prisoners and free men,
there was some little consolation in that.</p>

<p class='c004'>As she emerged once more from the wooded
avenue, her eye fell full on the house. She was
surprised and startled at its beauty, viewed thus from
the back. Whereas looking at it from the street it
showed as nothing but a large square mansion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>almost ugly in its plainness, it was from here one
of the most graceful and artistic buildings she had
ever seen. It was turreted and towered, with
polished oriel windows, shining with a lustre all
their own against the dusky background of dark
marble. The windows on the basement all opened
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe this is the front, and the front is the
back,” thought she. “A kind of topsy-turvy, like
the rest of things. What a magnificent door!”</p>

<p class='c004'>This last expression escaped her involuntarily
and aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door from which she had come was a small
side one leading from the conservatory of palms
and ferns, but in the centre of this huge construction
of glass was a double door of thick carved glass,
or some substance very like it, of fine workmanship
and execution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie went up the many steps towards it, passing
the silver fountain that fell with almost a merry
sound into the marble basin. Both leaves of the
door were shut, and the carving represented was that
of a temple, the inner portion, with arched aisles and
fluted pillars, and in the centre an altar, with above
it the image of a toad. Below it, on the steps
outside the customary railing, bowed figures knelt
in bare feet, their shoes and stockings at some
considerable distance. The representation was
comprehensive. Each figure and detail was drawn
with great exactness and clearness. The curious
polish it possessed was its most striking feature,
especially that brilliancy radiating from the toad.
Rosalie bent her eyes closer to it, shuddered to
find that there was something horribly repulsive in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>such an animal, and then found herself attracted by
the light shining from its head. Its eyes were
meaningless and staring, even in the carved picture,
but from its head, and this she only discovered after
steady looking, the light shone very curiously.
Instead of the white light of the rest, this was
almost red. Just a faint tinge of red! All the rest,
carved as it were from blocks of ice, was utterly
lifeless. Yet it was this tinge of colour, so subtly
introduced, which made the whole great difference
between an uninteresting and an interesting thing.
At last she left it and looked down once more into
the garden. She saw that several narrow paths led
into the shrubberies at the sides. But what struck
her attention most was that glorious rising bank
of scarlet lilies and harebells and gladioli, that
extended right down one side to the wooded avenue
beyond, and reached almost to the height of the
wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>She perceived a narrow winding path led up this
bank to its summit, and there a garden seat was
placed. This was the highest point of vantage in
the garden.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe if I could only get up there I should
be able to see away over the opposite wall, for it’s
lower!” she cried excitedly. “Oh, how glorious to
be able to see the city and everything! I’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But alas! from the times of Cinderella downwards,
clocks have often had a knack of striking at
an awkward time. And now there came the sound
of chimes, the silver warning, and then the five
plain strokes that told the closing hour of fettered
liberty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie re-entered the house. In the central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>hall she met Mariana coming from the entrance
door in hat and jacket, and carrying a muff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where have you been?” she cried, running
across to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Out for a walk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Mariana! What a shame never to tell me,
and never to take me!” And she took hold of her
hands hungrily, and kissed her on either cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you kiss me?” the other asked, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To try to get some real fresh air into my lips.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not very fresh. There is quite a fog coming
on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! But it’s free air. I feel all the better just
for kissing you. But why do you never take
me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is against the rules.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why can you go, and not I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sure I don’t know. See, I have brought you
some sweets,” and Mariana held out a very pretty
box containing a delicious assortment of chocolates.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie took it, somehow more touched than she
liked to show by this simple little act of graciousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come and sit with me after tea, and let us eat
them together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid I cannot. I am always busy in
the evening.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Making a wedding-dress.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you going to marry, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no; I’m not making it for myself. I don’t
know that it is a wedding-dress either. However,
I am making it very beautifully, and so I am
ambitious for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is going to wear it?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Here Mariana’s brow puckered, and a puzzled,
tired look came on to her face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” she answered. “I expect if I
finish it, and no one applies for it or wants it, it
will shrivel up again. For there is no wardrobe
but what is overrun with moths; and the moths
here eat away all colours except red and black.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then how can you preserve it till it’s done?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By steeping the silk I sew it with in tears. But
when the last stitch is in the effect has gone. The
moths cannot perceive the bitterness afterwards.
They eat it all away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie stared at her, as well she might.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you let me see it?” she asked at length;
but Mariana shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would be no pleasure to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed it would. Let me see it, Mariana, just
for one minute. There can be possibly no harm in
that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The room I sew in is very damp for such as you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I’m stronger than you. I’m accustomed to
hard work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other looked at her and smiled, with more
sadness than mirth in her expression.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What strange ideas you get about things, Rosalie.
The work I do would kill you in a month.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you will let me come with you, will you
not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, if you wish it very much. After tea at six
o’clock I will come for you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <span class='large'>AN ACT OF DISOBEDIENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>At six o’clock Mariana knocked at the little sitting-room
door, and Rosalie opened it, quite ready to
accompany her, armed with the box of sweets.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must not bring those,” said the elder
woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I want you to have some.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not like you. I’m not fond of sweets, and
have no intention of making my fingers sticky.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie put them down, and followed her in
silence and obedience.</p>

<p class='c004'>They went downstairs together, and took the door
opening into the central hall to the right, the one
through which Rosalie had not yet passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at the threshold Rosalie stood still. It seemed
to her as if a great spider’s web was barring their
further progress. A breath of darkness and dampness
was wafted out to meet them, and inclination
bade her turn back there and then. Mariana
evidently noticed nothing of this hesitation; she
passed through the door, and held it open for Rosalie
to follow. The gigantic cobweb was nothing but
delusion evidently, and melted into nothingness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t shut the door,” Rosalie whispered; but it
had closed silently even as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>And here was darkness and cold dampness. She
heard her heart beat wildly in the stillness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>groped for Mariana’s arm. It seemed cold and
lifeless, having no animation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t we get a light?” she whispered, with dry
lips, and her voice sounded hollow in her own
hearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The light is farther down the passage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That, at least, was reassurance. It was Mariana’s
voice, no different from what it ever was, just as
subdued and gentle.</p>

<p class='c004'>By degrees her eyes became accustomed to the
intense gloom, and when Mariana turned on the one
flickering light, she recognised a length of passage
similar to that in the other two wings. But here the
doors were all quite low, and made of plain black
wood. There was no attempt at adornment. The
floor was plain wood, the walls, the ceilings, and
everything was dreary, damp, and cold.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doors, too, were numbered all in red, and it
was before No. 13 that Mariana stopped. It opened
to her touch, and together they entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the room I work in,” said Mariana, and
again turned on one feeble light. It seemed the
only one in the chamber.</p>

<p class='c004'>The black rafters of oak hung low above their
heads, and their heaviness perhaps helped to increase
the gloomy aspect of the place. A long table of deal
ran down the centre, with a chair at either end. This
table was covered with a white cloth reaching the
ground on either side.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two chests of oak, shabby and worn, were the
only articles of furniture the room possessed. The
walls were whitewashed. Here and there the plaster
had fallen from them, with a dispiriting effect.
There was neither fireplace nor window in the room.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Can you work in here?” Rosalie asked, looking
round with an involuntary shiver.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. One becomes accustomed to surroundings.
I never notice them; I’m too absorbed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She went to the table and drew away the cloth,
folding it, and placing it upon one of the vacant
chairs. Below, a shimmer of satin, and gold, and
silver, all strikingly in contrast to the bareness and
poorness of the room, met the eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How lovely!” said Rosalie, drawing her breath.
“Do you know, I thought that big white cloth was
the material, and it looked to my eyes more like a
shroud.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is only the material,” said Mariana. “I
finished it the day you came, after being engaged
on it three years. It is all hand-spun and woven,
but now I’ve put the loom and spinning-wheel
away in those big chests. One does not want too
many things about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But who taught you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! it is knowledge one acquires. It needs a
certain kind of brain and a given pattern, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she went over to one of the chests and
opened it, and took from it a parcel which she untied.
It contained a quantity of most lovely lace, the
like of which Rosalie had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you make this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; it belongs to the Master. I found it in
the lumber rooms among the attics, and asked him
for it, and so he gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gave it to you? It looks almost priceless.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know—reckoned from some standpoints. But
I liked the design. It is lovers’ knots, and sprays
of lily of the valley. Have you noticed it?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was that that put it in my head about the
wedding-dress. When I have finished, it will be a
beautiful creation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But do not the moths attack the lace?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no; you see it belongs to the Master,
otherwise it would have been eaten long ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why do you not wear it yourself, if he gave
it to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the tired, puzzled look came over Mariana’s
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have no use for it. Besides—I don’t know.
I think it has something to do with sacrifice or
freedom. I can’t tell which.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you give it to Lady Flamington, do you
think?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall not give it to anyone, except the one
who asks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you will be besieged.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How can that be when no one knows about it?”
And she spread the lace upon the ivory satin, and
drew it into graceful folds, just as an understanding
artist would. As she did so, even by the meagre
light Rosalie perceived its exquisite beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is to be fitted for it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. One does not like to trouble
people; I think I shall use my own discretion.
After all, I scarcely hope that anyone will wear it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could I be of use to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is too cold for you to take off your dress.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! Let me do it, just to feel I’ve done
something in the day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you,” said Mariana. “You are neither
too tall nor short. I think it would show to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>advantage on a figure like yours. I’ll fit it for just
such a one as you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She cut a piece from the soft piles of satin, and
began to shape it to a bodice lining.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you going to try it on with <em>satin</em>?” asked
Rosalie, astounded at such extravagance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; inside and out must be both alike for a
perfect finish. I might use silk, but I prefer the
same material.”</p>

<p class='c004'>What a marvellous fitter on she was! and yet how
wonderfully patient Rosalie stood, the whole long
evening through. It was no light twenty minutes—not
even an hour—but dragged out into three.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana forgot herself evidently in her occupation,
and had no mercy on the model she was fitting.
She treated her as a thing of wood and stone till
she had realised the full effect in fit of bodice, skirt,
and train, which, when perfected, she removed and
folded into tissue papers, all labelled for the purpose
near at hand. Then suddenly when all was finished
she looked at her, and saw how deathly white her
face had grown under the lengthened strain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! now you are ill, and I am to blame for it,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie shook her head, though she shivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the cold; everything is so damp down
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Indeed, it has been kind of you. I never
hoped to get a model. We can’t ask favours of each
other here, and I’m sorry if I tired you; but—but—I
don’t know whether it may not be against the rule,
so it was best to complete it before the Master came,
in order to plead ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Truly this last was the most human thing Mariana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>had ever said to her, the only deviation from a hard,
set rule of living.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Rosalie, smiling despite the faintness
and shivering that overcame her. “When you’ve
done a thing no one can say anything, can they?
At least, they can’t say much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana helped her on with her customary dress,
and just then the clock outside struck nine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My work-time is up now,” she said. “I will
return with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps no one ever greeted fire, and light,
and warmth as Rosalie did when back in the
small sitting-room in the storey up above. In
bed at night she remembered the moths that had
flickered round the dim light, and round her also,
as if claiming this work as soon as finished, and
identifying her with it, so it almost seemed to her.
And yet how beautiful the thing had looked, how
out of place with its surroundings! Suddenly great
tears of bitterness fell on the pillow for this lonely
woman, so utterly without the pale of human
sympathy, and yet so uncomplaining. How
beautiful she was! Once during the fitting on
she had thrown a piece of satin on her shoulder,
too busy for the second to turn round and put it
down. And how its ivory smoothness had matched
the smoothness of her neck and cheek. How well
it had contrasted with her dark eyes and hair. And
then there was about her such a nameless grace and
gentle refinement! Yet there she had worked in
the cold, damp cell, and been content to work, with
apparently no hope for the future, but moths and
mildew and decay.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in the midst of these reveries on Mariana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>that Rosalie fell asleep, to wake many times
throughout the night, shivering, to think herself
alone within that gloomy room below, tried on for
shrouds by ghosts with horrid grinning laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a night in no wise likely to raise Rosalie’s
spirits from the curious depths of unreality and pain
where they had fallen; yet towards morning she fell
into a sleep so deep, that she never awoke from it
till Mariana came to call and waken her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana,” she said, “you promised you would
show me Mr. Todbrook’s portrait yesterday, and
you never did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is in the picture-gallery. You could have
found it for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know where the picture-gallery is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had forgotten. If you wait for me in the
corridor after breakfast I will show it to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So after breakfast Rosalie went out into the
passage to wait for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gallery was downstairs in that same wing,
facing toward the gardens, where the conservatory
was.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a very large gallery, longer than broad,
with polished floor, and seats upholstered in red
velvet stood along the walls. The light was
admitted from the roof, but very beautiful electric
candelabra hung from the ceiling, which was all
panelled and carved in black oak.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana led the way to the portrait of the late
owner of the Marble House. There he stood in
the correct evening dress for a man of his position,
with one hand leaning on a table and the other
by his side. He was slightly built and scarcely of
middle height, with a refined, delicate, and quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>face, and a look of wistful melancholy in his eyes
that interested and attracted Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who painted it?” she asked, after studying it
for some time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. There is no name to it. I think
myself the Master may have done it. It was painted
after death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From his corpse?” asked Rosalie, in horror.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! From memory, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does Mr. Barringcourt paint, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In his spare time, yes. I think he must have
done this. I don’t know who else could. Even
millionaires are bad to remember when once they’ve
passed away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it like him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. But Everard says it is almost
lifelike.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is Everard?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The man who keeps the door.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like him at the door. Do you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana looked up with almost startled eyes.
“Don’t like him? I like everyone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like him,” persisted Rosalie. “He’s one
of those men who always does what he is told. If
Mr. Barringcourt told him to wring your neck round,
or mine, he’d do it soon—as soon as wink.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” said Mariana, as if that were the acme
of perfection.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he has neither heart nor head. Now, if
Mr. Barringcourt told me to wring your neck, I’d tell
him to do it himself, I’d had no practice that way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana looked at her in utter surprise, and then
suddenly she sank back upon the velvet seat, and
began to laugh. Unhappily, her merriment did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>last, for almost as suddenly she jumped up again,
her face white with pain, and her features drawn and
contracted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, for Heaven’s sake don’t make me laugh!
The pain at my heart is something terrible,” and she
caught Rosalie’s arm in her hand, quite unconscious
of the strength of the grip she had taken.</p>

<p class='c004'>In surprise and alarm, the unconscious offender
stood still.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” she gasped at length. “Is the pain
very bad?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana looked at her and nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Talk about one’s heart breaking,” she said, with
a wintry smile. “Every time I laugh I get that
feeling.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let us go away,” said Rosalie, noticing that the
great pallor of her face did not decrease.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. It’s time I was back at—at the wedding
garment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you’re not going to that damp, dark place
this morning, are you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I shall come with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I told Everard, and he does not approve.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he is not master here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; but his advice is very good to go upon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did I not tell you how heartless he was?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mistake what is meant for kindness. Let
us go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the central hall she took leave of Rosalie, and
disappeared inside the gloomy eastern wing. And
Rosalie made no further attempt to come with her,
for her horror of the previous night was still fresh in
her mind.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“I don’t know how Mariana can do it,” she thought,
standing still in the great hall. “It’s killing her.
She looked like death this morning. And to go there
right away, to be buried in that damp sepulchre!
It’s terrible, terrible! I <em>hate</em> Mr. Barringcourt! He’s
bad—right-down bad! The worst man I know!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But then she knew so very few.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was awakened from this reverie to find
Everard, the doorkeeper, coming toward her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her first impulse was to turn away and walk
toward the staircase, which she did.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Paleaf!”</p>

<p class='c004'>His tone attracted her immediate attention. There
was a certain strong gravity in it that appealed to
what gravity and steadiness there was in her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she answered, turning round to view this
wringer of necks in prospective.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have endeavoured to do an incredible
amount of harm since coming here. Don’t you think
it would be advisable to practise a little self-control?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I think if it were practicable it would be
advisable to shut myself up in a tin box, or oak,
perhaps, and turn round once a week for recreation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You rush from one extreme to the other without
any attempt at reason.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And—and you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For Mariana’s sake I wish to advise you to be
careful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not for my own?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I know nothing about you, and you seem
pretty capable of looking after yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at him, not knowing whether her
dislike was growing or lessening.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know you’re taking a great liberty?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>she said, her colour rising despite her efforts to
keep cool.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. And under the circumstances it is
pardonable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are doing your best to destroy the
happiness and peace of a working woman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Happiness! Happiness! Do you call it
happiness to be fastened up in there the greater
part of the day-time?” And she pointed to
the door through which Mariana had passed a
short time before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When she is contented it is, at least, the nearest
approach to happiness. And your ignorant meddling
can never have a good result.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie was silent, and with no heart to
answer she turned away, and went upstairs to the
little sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her own heart ached enough in all conscience.
O God! to be free! away from all this coldness
and hardness, and gloom and silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>She buried her face in her hands and cried from
utter dejection. When she went to wash her hands
and face for dinner, she was dismayed at her own
plain looks. She was very far from being ready for
a meal, and made little attempt or pretence at eating
what was placed before her. At last the young man
who waited on her presented a red lozenge to her
on a silver plate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” she asked, not being accustomed
to this particular dish.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The nutriment you require to keep you in
health. You have eaten nothing, and this is less
troublesome if you have no appetite.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>She frowned in indecision, and for one minute
looked at him and then at it. Then without
another word she ate the contents of her plate,
and afterwards a plate of plain milk pudding.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when alone again the same weak desire to
cry began to gain upon her, and it was only after
a very hard fight she overcame it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know how it is,” she sighed. “They
make you do things here however much you don’t
want to. I wonder now if the eating of my dinner
was a lesson in self-control.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she went back to her bedroom and shut
the door, and knelt down by the bed to pray, if
prayer it could be called. Despite her efforts,
everything was most incoherent and jumbled, broken
by big sobs, and ending in no prayer at all, but
silence. At last the silence must have brought its
effect of soothing, for Rosalie rose from her knees
with scarcely a vestige of the past emotion upon
her face. She combed her hair and smoothed her
dress, and then went for her hat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll go into the garden,” she said, “and see if
I can see the city.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a glorious afternoon, with just sufficient
sharpness for autumn in the air. It was considerably
after three by the tower clock, and she
recognised with regret there was time for little
more than an hour there. Her hopes were realised.
From the top of the red bank of flowers she could
view the city very plainly. She saw right across to
the high-standing temple, with every building of
note and height rising in between. Behind her she
could see nothing, for the wall rose exceptionally
high, but from here she could look in the direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of the old home, and to that other magnificent
erection that contained all the best prayers and
aspirations of her dumb life.</p>

<p class='c004'>After all, to look on to the sights of freedom is
in a measure to the prisoner freedom itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the city beyond, Rosalie’s eyes wandered
back toward the mansion. There was something
wanting in it; its magnificent outline attracted
and repelled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a lovely fairy story one could write about
it,” she sighed. “It seems to me a kind of haunted,
sleeping palace; and everything looks so strong, and
dark, and silent, and yet beautiful, that I don’t know
whether the story would have to turn out well
or ill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She sat down on the rustic seat with the arbour
of trailing leaves twining above it, and dreamily
contemplated the wide expanse of city.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly she heard the ominous striking of the
mansion clock.</p>

<p class='c004'>One! two! three! four! five!</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie turned her eyes from the sky and looked
at it. A faint pink flush from the sun was shining
on it, and she clasped her hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t go in. They can’t do anything to me if
I don’t. Five o’clock! the very nicest time of all
the day—the only time to see the city and the sun
look at their best. It isn’t wrong of me; I know it
isn’t. I haven’t done anything wrong that I should
be a prisoner. I haven’t, really. I feel I haven’t!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sunset deepened.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the great gates leading from the garden
flew open to admit a dog-cart and one chestnut horse
driven by Mr. Barringcourt. Behind him sat a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>groom, and as they took the sweep of drive leading
past her toward the terrace steps, her eyes fell on the
horse and man in livery.</p>

<p class='c004'>She saw that they did not belong to this place.
What was there about everyone who lived here
that made them different from all else? That
groom was just the ordinary groom that one saw
every day within the streets and parks.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Mr. Barringcourt passed below he suddenly
looked up, and catching sight of her, took off his
hat and smiled. Rosalie’s heart gave a leap of
excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flush of evening had dyed her pale cheeks,
and given lustre to her eyes. She watched the
light vehicle draw up below the central steps, saw
Mr. Barringcourt dismount, and the groom lead the
horse away by the shorter carriage drive. Rosalie
clasped her hands and watched, and made no sign
of moving down.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the sunset deepened.</p>

<p class='c004'>For one minute Mr. Barringcourt stood on the
steps looking at his boots, or maybe on the ground,
in apparent thoughtfulness; then he turned round
with sudden decision, and crossed the lawn to the
path leading towards the bank of flowers where she
stood. Yet no step downward did Rosalie take in
that direction, and so he came up the narrow,
winding path, and very shortly reached her.</p>

<p class='c004'>And how different from all the others he appeared!
How full of life and animation! how strong! how
quick at seeing, and therefore understanding!</p>

<p class='c004'>How weak and lifeless her hand felt in his! And
suddenly she felt that intense admiration for strength
which all weak things must have. Yet she searched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>his face narrowly for that tired and weary look that
she had seen there twice before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her scrutiny was well returned. Out of the
purity of a lonely spirit longing for some companionship
her clear eyes had looked full into his, the
ending of a day of weakness and tears and silent
waiting. And under the deep scrutiny of those
stronger eyes she had not power to look aside till
every little secret not worth hiding had been read.
Then having got rid of all the weakness, Rosalie
came to the reserve strength.</p>

<p class='c004'>She drew her hand out of his, and asked suddenly,
with an everyday interest:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you any horses of your own, Mr.
Barringcourt, or do you hire them all?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have my own; but they’re too good for
everyday work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But when do you exercise them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Occasionally at midnight I give them a run
round. They are black, so they don’t show. Nor
do they advertise their coming by too much
noise.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This time she looked at him with puzzled
incredulity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What I say. Why are you waiting here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To see the sun set.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has set.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m waiting for the afterglow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And as she spoke, the whole sky from east to
west flushed to a sudden lowering crimson. It was
reflected on his face, on hers, shone from the many
windows—red—red—a sea of golden red and copper
colour, dyeing all things.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“But you have no business out here after sunset,
have you?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. You should be judge of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m judge of nothing except the mood I’m in,
and to-day I’m not sorry to find you here; but it’s
rather a dangerous game to play in a place where
strict discipline is observed. Don’t you know it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I couldn’t imagine any punishment worse
than being a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could you not? Oh, there are many worse.
You are a prisoner at large, you must remember.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The reason why I stayed out is because I could
think of nothing I had done wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you a good judge of your misdoings?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. A tongue makes things so
complicated.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “What have you been doing since I
went away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trying to be contented, and help Mariana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Help Mariana?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I tried on a dress for her last night, but
the room was so gloomy I dare not go again this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What kind of a dress were you trying on?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A wedding-dress that gave me the shivers. Do
you know, Mr. Barringcourt, I think Mariana the
most splendid woman I ever met.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and I think she’s the most shamefully
ill-used woman, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one is ill-used, except dogs and dumb animals
in general.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie gave him one of her sidelong penetrating
glances.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Well,” said she, “there are dumb animals and
dumb animals; Mariana is dumb.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What I mean is, she never complains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very sensible of her. There is no one to listen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is Everard! She asks his advice upon
everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She told you that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. She talks about everything but her own
hard life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is why you wish her to speak about it.
Did she do so, you would wish her silent. The
world is very contrary, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stepped aside to let her pass before him down
the narrow path. There was no alternative but to
obey, as the sunset had now completely died away, and
the dusk of night and its accompanying chilliness
had wandered in, bringing a sense of desolation, of
misery.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Master did not lead the way to the side door,
but approached the central one. He let himself in
by touching some spring acting in the toad’s head,
and Rosalie followed with a creepy sense of awe as
she passed between these high doors, with their
magnificent workmanship all hidden in the dusk.</p>

<p class='c004'>The darkness of the big conservatory was partly
dispelled by tiny electric lights, coloured crimson,
that glimmered here and there among the foliage
like glow-worms in a forest. As they passed the
picture-gallery, Mr. Barringcourt noticed that the
door was open.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who has been in there?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana and I went this morning to see Mr.
Todbrook’s portrait. Who painted it?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“I did—from memory. A man’s best friend should
represent him most faithfully. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But had you nothing to work from?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! Nothing but memory. Memory is a
very wonderful thing if one only cultivates it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I died, do you think you could paint me?”
asked Rosalie, turning her face up to his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he answered. “I have not known you quite
long enough. I could attempt nothing better than a
caricature at present.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed, and said: “I must endeavour to live
a little longer, then.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE FOLLY OF SIMPLICITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Together they entered the central hall, and saw
Mariana standing waiting there. When she saw
Rosalie she stepped towards her, but on seeing Mr.
Barringcourt beyond her she stood still.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you waiting for?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For Rosalie. It is long past her time for coming
in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have wonderful patience to stand here
waiting. Anyone else would have gone to look for
her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If one waits long enough one generally gets what
one wants,” she answered, rather irrelevantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, don’t stand there any longer. You’re not
needed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned away with grace and easy dignity, and
walked toward the staircase; but when there she
looked across at Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tea is ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>What a dungeon-knell there was in those three
words! Tea in that little shabby sitting-room, away
from everything of light, or life, or understanding.
A piece of bread, a cup of tea and whatever else was
going, eaten alone, and the dreariness of a long dull
evening beyond. And somehow or other the thought
of the evening frightened Rosalie. It was so dark.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The long passages above so ghostly, dim, and silent.
And below? She shivered and looked towards the
door of the eastern wing, that in some unaccountable
way seemed to pervade all things with its shadow
and odour of graves.</p>

<p class='c004'>So though Mariana, after she had spoken, stood still
and waited a while for the effect of her words, Rosalie
delayed to follow her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The freedom and grandeur of the sunset was
still running in her veins; the pleasantness of conversation
and companionship had its influence on
her also.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ought I to go?” she asked suddenly, looking up
at Mr. Barringcourt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. If you admire Mariana
as much as you profess I think you should go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t a case of Mariana. It’s me—myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what of you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d much rather stay, and have my tea with—with
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t indulge in tea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then do they insist on your eating a red lozenge
instead?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! They recognise that I am quite able to
look after myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everard told me I was capable of doing that.
And yet at dinner-time to-day I was presented with
a red lozenge on a silver salver to take the place of
ordinary food.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you accepted it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I didn’t. But if you don’t have tea, I’d
better leave you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll waive a point to-night. I have had so
pleasant a holiday that it is somewhat distasteful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to settle down again. Go and remove your hat, and
come down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But when Rosalie essayed to move towards the
staircase she found Mariana gone, and suddenly she
stood still.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you stop?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’m frightened! I really am! I dare not go
about this place at night by myself. I don’t know
how it is, but I dare not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing will hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the shadows and the darkness—and the
silence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Run along. It’s your imagination.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure there’s nothing to be frightened
of?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing!”</p>

<p class='c004'>So Rosalie went, and returned like the wind. Her
eyes shone with fear, and her breath came in quick
pants.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did you see?” he asked, laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing! I did not stay long enough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So then, in the comfortable cheerfulness of Mr.
Barringcourt’s study, they had tea.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie sat in the big arm-chair by the fire; he in
his customary one drawn from the table. Very proud
she felt to pour out tea, and quite forgave the youth
who waited on them for his officious behaviour of the
morning. Besides, this was such delicious tea. It
was not a bit like that which she had upstairs. The
china was superb, with far richer colours than Crown
Derby, or anything at all resembling it upon the
planet Lucifram.</p>

<p class='c004'>No wonder that, in the midst of all this luxury
and comfort, with a glorious fire and sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>light, she heaved an unconscious sigh of great
contentment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still discontented?” asked Mr. Barringcourt,
breaking the heavenly silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! Just the opposite. I sighed because I
was so happy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you any book on etiquette?” he continued,
casting an eye round his own well-filled book-shelves
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Etiquette? What is that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good behaviour, I think, but I’m not sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I haven’t any book on etiquette; but I
remember what my aunt taught me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what did she tell you?” he asked, leaning
his head against the chair-back, and looking across
at her out of half-closed eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She told me always to be polite to people, and
unselfish. You see, there wasn’t much else she could
tell, because I couldn’t talk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To be polite and unselfish! Umph! that’s good
behaviour, is it? I think I’ve explained etiquette
wrongly to you, then.” After a silence he continued:
“I believe etiquette has to do with correct behaviour.
Do you know anything about that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I expect that is being stiff. No, I don’t
know anything about that. We weren’t at all stiff
at home. You see, there was no need to be. We
had no servants nor anything, and we always said
what we thought. At least, uncle and aunt did, and
I listened. But why are you asking about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m very undecided in my mind about you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I get very undecided about myself sometimes.
I don’t think aunt would approve of me
altogether now.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My tongue. It is so sharp, you know. You said
it was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I’m not thinking about your tongue. I am
trying to settle whether we are breaking the laws of
etiquette in thus drinking tea together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! The curates always do it, and they
are more correct than anybody. They like you to
offer them tea. Aunt used to say so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we are just as we should be?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Does Lady Flamington never come to
have tea with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I generally go there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s just the same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who told you of Lady Flamington?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana. Mariana does not give you a very good
character, you know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And is your strength of mind great enough to
withstand her libels?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, yes. I like to form my own opinions.
Besides, the best fun is, Mariana does not understand
she’s saying anything against you. She tells me all
kinds of things, taking you quite for granted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When do you find time for these interesting
conversations?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At night—and sometimes in the early morning.
She never neglects her work to gossip. But when she
talks it’s always to the point.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie, if you wish to possess any fascination,
which is another word for beauty, you must learn to
keep all your thoughts, opinions, and feelings to
yourself. It is not conducive to interest to be told
of a person’s state too freely. One must be left to
find it for oneself.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Do you find me uninteresting?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very much so. I do not know another man of
my acquaintance on Lucifram who would tolerate
your company for half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her eyes travelled to his with a very real and living
pain in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know anything about men except that
they’re very clever. But I’d be quite content to earn
the good graces of the women.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why either?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, because one must be friendly somewhere. It
would be awful to have no friends at all, men or
women.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How many friends would you need for
happiness?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As many as I could get. You see, when you’re
poor you can’t expect to have many.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And when you’re rich you have less.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, indeed. I’m sure you have heaps of friends,
Mr. Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed in a harsh, dry sort of way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You flatter me. In reality, I have no more friends
than you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But Lady Flamington?—Why, Mariana says she
is in love with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt bit his lip; but the smile debarred
access there travelled to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what if she is in love with me, as you call it.
That makes her one of my worst enemies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! To love anybody is to be their best and
biggest friend.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I grant if the love be disinterested; but then, how
often is it so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does disinterested mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” he answered impatiently;
“you must look it out in a dictionary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sorry,” Rosalie answered meekly, “but I
thought disinterested meant unselfish—and I can’t
understand love being anything else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t you? Then you have much to learn.
Why do you love the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The question came with unexpected rapidity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t. I—I—I—” Another pause upon the
thrice repeated unlucky vowel—and Rosalie shivered
from head to foot quite coldly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is this an attempt at fascination?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The tone was so cold and cruel, and the words
carried so sharp a sting, that they cut Rosalie’s heart
like some whip might have done.</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand the Serpent,” she said, rubbing
her hands against the chair arm. “How, then, can I
love it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That implies that you <em>do</em> understand the Serpent,
and therefore you are not disposed to love him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You aspire to understand me better than I
understand myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! I take you at your own word. I asked
you did you love the Serpent, and you said, ‘I don’t.’
Surely there was not much to understand in that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t let us quarrel,” pleaded Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quarrel? Quarrel? Oh, no, certainly not. I had
no intention of quarrelling with you. I remember
your telling me the other day you had no particular
affection for the god of Lucifram.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But do <em>you</em> love the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I—I—I—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is unkind of you, and not polite.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“We ought to have your aunt here to act as
chaperon. They say it’s scarcely wise to leave a
man and woman to themselves, and now I recognise
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie was not far behind in the argument.
From cold shivers she began to experience a certain
amount of heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know about a chaperon,” she said. “I
thought a chaperon was a woman who looked after
a woman, and I should like to know who looks after
the men? Chaperons are silly and stupid, and
women, if they were honest, would say they wanted
to have nothing to do with them. Besides, it was
you who lost your temper then. I didn’t a bit. I
haven’t yet, only you annoyed me by the way you
spoke.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I? lost my temper?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, of course. You know you did. You think
I’ve got a secret, and I haven’t; so if you don’t like,
you needn’t be nice to me any more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Mr. Barringcourt laughed. Under that laugh
Rosalie shrivelled up like a white butterfly under the
breath of ice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I do like,” he answered, still laughing. “You
must not quote from Mariana. It is too absurd.
And so you have no secret. I can scarcely imagine
a woman without one, nor a man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The merciless mocking eyes were fixed on her,
so that she seemed incapable of moving. There rose
within her a terrible weakness, a longing to lean on
him, to be guided by his advice, to speak of all those
doubts that preyed upon her mind, and state the few
plain facts that raised them. Again, as before in the
garden, she recognised that he was strong, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>was very, very weak. She looked across at him.
There was little of sympathy on his face—much of
contempt and ridicule—and Rosalie, sensitive to both,
shrank from it and him.</p>

<p class='c004'>A very awkward pause followed—to her, at least.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think the tea-party is ended,” he said, getting
up and pushing his chair back to the table. “It was
very enjoyable whilst it lasted, but there is such a
thing as folk outstaying their welcome.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But still she sat still, and made no effort to rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has made you angry?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. You say I’m angry, so I
must be. You should be able to discover the cause
when you’ve noticed the effect.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t. But when I stumble or stammer I notice
it always puts you out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then don’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll try not. But if I sometimes said the things I
thought, they’d sound so foolish that you’d laugh at
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They could not possibly be more foolish than
the things you say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are all the women of your acquaintance very
sensible and clever?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“More or less so. Of course, they have the
advantage of education and upbringing; but still that
does not do away with the fact that they possess
many natural gifts.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must be very nice to possess natural gifts.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Few women are born without them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Am I one of the few?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So far as I can judge you are. With talent and
cleverness, you should be able to escape from
prison.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“But I’m staying here on principle. I never
thought of trying to get away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That shows your inherent stupidity, and a
surprising lack of spirit. Cannot you find a door of
escape?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie shook her head and sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she answered. “I thought of the chimney
once, but that was absurd.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can you think of no other door?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. It’s no good my trying to get out where
every door is either locked or guarded.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have not wit enough to think of one, you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps so,” she answered, and looked at him
with eyes full of a great and wistful longing to be
told.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ll tell you. There is the door of my heart.
Any other woman would have thought of it at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve had no practice that way. I shouldn’t know
how to go about to find it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No? As women go, you are intensely stupid.
You possess all the disadvantages of a school-girl,
without any of the attractions of youth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not very old,” said Rosalie. “I’m only
twenty-three.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There you are again. You can keep nothing to
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I only told you what my age was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ve none of the curiosity of a census paper,
and women who tell their ages are a pest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because it is either a boast or a lie. Both are
objectionable. Keep your age to yourself. No one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>wants to know it, and if they do, let them find out or
guess.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that what the clever women do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. If you become a clever woman at
second hand, you will become an abomination.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What must I do then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remain stupid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’ll never get away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no; as soon as I pointed the way I blocked
it. Had you discovered it yourself, it might have
been unguarded.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe you would have let me through,
even if I had found it out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not. One never believes that which
touches one’s vanity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie sighed. What a contrary mood had
suddenly seized him! She got up, with little of life
or spirit in her movements.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then if you find me so very dull I won’t come
again. Three years seem a long time, but I have no
doubt God will help me to live through them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God, being dumb, refuses no one, least of all
religious women, they force themselves upon Him so
persistently. Yes, I shall be glad to be relieved of
your company for a while. And so please confine
your wanderings to the upper storey where you live.
And leave the garden to those who can appreciate its
beauty sufficiently to be in by five o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at him. Pain and fear was on her
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Live upstairs!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; live upstairs. And eat red lozenges when
your appetite is bad. You can’t die, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>She turned toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-night!” he said, drawing an open book
toward him on the table, and sitting down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-night! I see now my fault and punishment
in staying out of doors beyond the time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For only answer he laughed. As he did so the
door closed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <span class='large'>BROKEN SPIRITS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>So full of pain and heaviness was Rosalie that all
her childish fear had vanished. She passed up the
slippery staircase into the corridor, from which her
own small sitting-room was.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never to go downstairs again for three long weary
years! Never to be out of the grey, silent, ghostly
shadows of those upper rooms—never to have human
companionship or friendliness! A part of the
meaning floated through her mind, and cast its
heavy shroud on all things.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was still early in the evening, too early for
Mariana to return from the work which held her.
She sat down in the high-backed chair before the
fire, and listlessly looked into it. The flames burnt
low. There was none of the brightness of the other
day in them—no whispered message of hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s spirit ached more from the cruel heartlessness
of the Master’s conduct than even from the
thought of coming imprisonment. For this was in
the present—that the future. None had ever spoken
so to her before—sharply, no doubt but never with
this harsh and cruel coldness. Every feeling in her
simple nature seemed outraged and lacerated. Once
only she moved uneasily in her chair, as one undergoes
some great pain, and cried, or rather moaned:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s unfair—unfair! I haven’t done anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>that’s wrong, and it was silly and stupid of me to
ever think of coming back again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the door opened, and Mariana entered with
supper. Rosalie did not turn round till they were
alone again, and scarcely even then, till Mariana
came and stood beside her, and looking down,
said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie, why did you not come in at five
o’clock?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t ask me. I was foolish. There is no other
reason.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is Mr. Barringcourt’s company more agreeable
than mine?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought it was, and have paid the penalty.
Don’t reproach me. I can’t stand it to-night.
Perhaps to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t wish to reproach you. Once I thought
the same, for an hour or two, like you. But I got
over it as you have done. You will not care for his
company now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is well. I suppose you know you are not
to go downstairs again?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. What am I to do, Mariana, to pass the
time away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know of anything. I wish you had come
in by five o’clock. There are so many interesting
things below.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I didn’t come in, so there’s an end of it!
I’ll take supper now and go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She sipped the glass of warm milk silently, and
then together they went to bed. How cold it was in
the corridor. How ill lit and melancholy it appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>And Rosalie lay awake, with burning tears, which
were never shed, in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Three years! And Mr. Barringcourt had said a
woman of brains or spirit would have forestalled
them and have escaped.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then it seemed as if across the silence there
came that clear, pure voice that spoke to her before,
after her aunt was dead: “Neither brains nor spirit,
but the path directed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And silence and sleep and comfort fell—night’s
gentle curtain and soft pillow for all weary heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, long or short, according
to the circumstance. Each resembled some
long and silent eternity of Nothingness. Here was
nothing to do. Mariana said there was nothing, and
she knew best.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bring me a little bit of sewing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But she shook her head. “I cannot bring it from
the workroom.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then something from above.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is nothing. Each has her work; for you
there is none.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you no books?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Barringcourt has the key to the library. I
can ask him for one if you like.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie shook her head. “No, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And how difficult she found meal-times, when she
must force down food against all wish and inclination.
Sunday and Monday it was managed fairly well, but
on the Tuesday at dinner-time Rosalie recognised
the task was quite beyond her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All this tastes of cobwebs and damp soil,” she
said. “If I must have one, give me one of those
little lozenges you offered me the other day.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>It was brought. She took it with a glass of water,
then rose from her seat. When she got to the door
she turned round. Her pretty eyebrows were
slightly raised, and she laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was essence of cobweb, I believe. Thank
you; I feel better already for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All was lost upon the youth; he bowed gravely,
and returned no answer, and Rosalie went away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up and down! Up and down the long dim
corridor she walked, with nothing to do but think
or mope, or grow melancholy through despair.</p>

<p class='c004'>After tea Rosalie did not venture out beyond the
sitting-room, for the old fear of the darkness had
returned; and moreover, to-night a strange weariness
oppressed her. At last she fell asleep. Her head
rested on the table, and she slept there for nearly an
hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little after nine came Mariana and the
supper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is the dress progressing?” asked Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is doing very well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is Everard?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is very well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you seen Mr. Barringcourt to-day?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. He is away till to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you taken a walk this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A short one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My customary round. But you must not ask so
many questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because,” Mariana’s voice sank to a whisper, “if
we talk much I must leave you, and Sybilla will
come. And she never speaks all the week, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>on my one night out, and then in a language I never
heard before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s pale face grew paler. Suddenly she took
Mariana’s hand and held it very tight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are—are you making fun of me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other shook her head, and thus abruptly the
conversation ended.</p>

<p class='c004'>At midnight Rosalie suddenly awoke, to hear the
great clock striking—a sound which she had never
heard before in that room. The ache and weariness
of the evening had entirely vanished. She sat up in
bed and looked round the room, lit by one meagre
night-light. All was as usual, very still; the corners
of the room were all shadowy. In another second
Rosalie was standing on the floor looking around her
in a puzzled sort of way. Understanding came with
the swiftness of lightning to her brain. She stood
alert, listening, listening, but there was no sound.
Quickly and silently she dressed, holding her breath,
fearful of being found thus dressing in the middle of
the sleeping night. Then with courage screwed to
desperation she went toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I’m found out, God only knows what will
happen,” she thought and turned the handle.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had one advantage with all the rest of that big
house: it was silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mercifully, a few straggling moonbeams lit up the
room, shining from door to door, leaving the rest
in obscurity. Without glancing toward the shadowy
bed, she crossed to the outer door, opened it, and
stood in the corridor. The fears born of reality and
action had quite killed those of imagination. She
no longer started at shadows, nor trembled at the
darkness, but went on quickly till she reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>stairhead. Her shoes she carried in her hand to
prevent sound. She feared the slippery staircase,
lest she should stumble and waken some light
sleeper. But to-night it seemed scarcely so slippery
as before. Perhaps it was the descent in her unshod
feet. At last she stood safely at the bottom in the
large hall, with its Spartan plainness and great
richness. Chairs, each worth some small fortune,
statues in bronze and marble, and above all the
great, oppressive shadow, emanating from that
eastern door of glass, polished like diamonds, all
met her fearful glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If—if I fail—if I’m caught, that’s where I go—”</p>

<p class='c004'>The thought flashed like lightning through her
mind, and she looked round breathlessly to find a
doorway.</p>

<p class='c004'>That leading to the conservatory—it stood wide
open. On! On! along the corridor, dark but for one
dim electric light, such as was also shining in the
hall. Then through the palm-house, and toward
the central doors. A red spot gleamed upon the
centre—the toad’s head—for this door was carved
alike inside and out. Instinctively she touched the
shining knob. The door flew open. The cold damp
air of night wafted toward her as she stood thus
upon the threshold of the garden. Then, closing the
door behind her, she moved forward to the steps.
And here again Rosalie returned thanks to that light
upon the ugly head. For whereas within it showed
her where to touch the spring, here it shone with a
direct brilliancy that lit up the entire straight path
across the garden, right across and through the
wooded shrubbery at the farther end, that led toward
the stables. For though the faint light of night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>might have been strong enough to guide her to the
avenue of trees, nothing could ever penetrate this
heavy gloom, save only a light such as this steady
red one, that lit up the whole long path, right to the
stables, as clear toward the end as at the beginning.
So without trouble she came to the doorless building.
One gigantic slab of marble, between two pillars, was
slid back into the wall, and the red light penetrated
in beyond. She followed on the path it lit for her,
and stood within a sumptuous building. It was
certainly a stable, though at the moment it was
empty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here she looked round, not from curiosity, but to
find some means of exit. She walked round many
times, but found nothing but one small door, more
like a cupboard than a door, built low in the wall,
and quite beyond her power to open.</p>

<p class='c004'>She wrung her hands in despair, and a terrible
sweat broke out all over her. No way of escape!
Up to now all things had been so easy, as if aiding
and abetting her in this wild dream and dash for
freedom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly upon the still and ghostly midnight air
came a sound: the rhythmic trampling of horses,
and then a neigh half-echoed by another, as the
sound came nearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God help me!” she said, and leant against the
carved partition of two stalls, with that deathlike
sweat and fear robbing her limbs of any strength of
motion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The key! The key!”</p>

<p class='c004'>What voice was it that rang so clearly on the night?</p>

<p class='c004'>She fumbled in her pocket, and found the old
disused one of her uncle’s safe.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>With nothing but desperation for a guidance she
applied it to the little door, close-built to the ground.
It fitted and turned. The door flew open. As it did
so, from the garden came the crunching sound of
horses’ feet on gravel, and of wheels.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little door closed again. Rosalie was without
the precincts of Marble House, and breathed her first
long sigh of freedom.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <span class='large'>A WAYSIDE HOUSE AND GLOOMY CELL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>But what and where was this place that she had
come to? Instead of coming out upon a mews or
narrower street of that big city on the planet
Lucifram, she stood upon the borders of a wood.
Foxgloves, cowslips, and pale wood anemones
bordered its shaded paths. She passed onward,
conscious of a new sweetness in the air, and a
certain subdued light which, though faint, was
quite devoid of shadows.</p>

<p class='c004'>And oh! to tread upon a path of velvet—velvet
of Nature’s making, all soft and soothing to the
foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>And though the beauties of the forest awed, they
did not trouble her, for their shade was instinct with
the mood that she was in—a mood which had much
of quiet thankfulness, but no elation. With little
feeling of fatigue she walked along the pleasant
path, coming out at last upon a city all deserted.
Its buildings were the most majestic she had ever
seen. There was no ordinary streets of houses all in
a row. The buildings had the strength and beauty
of past ages. With courtyards of green, and gates
with armorial bearings, the windows of the houses
were narrow. During the ages, here and there a
cornice or a step had crumbled, giving a certain
hoary majesty to the houses, showing they had long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>withstood the inroads of all-conquering Time. No
sound of life enlivened the scene; all was silent as
the house which she had left. In the central square
two churches stood, one in a state of erection, one in
the middle stage of being pulled down. Truly it was
very curious. All around betokened signs of recent
workmanship. But as in dreams one cannot pause
to reason, neither did she.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through the silent empty streets she passed, and
came once more on to a stretch of country which
rose in hills not far off. These were steep and high,
as Rosalie found on coming nearer to them, but the
path bordered with wild flowers led her to and up
them, and when at last she stood upon the summit
of one that rose amongst the highest, she looked
down upon a country of gentle slopes and valleys,
and dark stretches of forest. A broad and glorious
river rolled its even course picturesquely, curving to
right and left, here disappearing in the shade of the
woodlands, here glittering in the rising sun. With
more heart and renewed vigour she descended from
the hill-top into this pleasant country beyond it.
The path led along the boundaries of a wood, and
suddenly there came in sight a low white house,
lying far back within a wide expanse of garden,
banked with wild flowers of Nature’s growing. On
the sunny side it was unshaded by the forest, and
deep-coloured peaches were glowing in the light.
A low verandah ran along the façade, and many
sweet and lovely creepers twined about its slender
pillars. The big front door stood open, also the
garden gate. Rosalie, with tired feet and thankful
heart, went up to it and knocked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Within was a simply-furnished hall, arranged with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>simplest taste. Bowls of roses stood upon the tables,
and the windows, in the recesses formed by the
window seats, were open, admitting straggling stems
of flowers that clustered upward from below. Built
in the wall was a golden fluted organ, the ivory
keyboard open, and all the mystic stops clear to the
view.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie knocked.</p>

<p class='c004'>A door at the farther end of the house opened,
and a youth appeared, coming toward her. He
was so handsome, and walked with such grace and
youthful brightness, that Rosalie’s heart went out
toward him on the instant. He did not wait for
any word of explanation, but said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father will be very pleased to see you. We
have been expecting your arrival for almost a week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But where did I come from?” asked Rosalie,
as taken with his gentle way of speaking as his
appearance.</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know; but from a hot place and a great
distance, I should think, or else your wits would never
have been sharpened to take so long a journey.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder how old he is?” thought she. “Fourteen
at the most. He should have more respect for me
than to speak so—so freely; and yet it’s nice to be
spoken to quite humanly again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she answered; “I’ve come a very long
distance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come this way. See my father, and then you
may rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took her to a room furnished simply, and not
unlike that of Mr. Barringcourt’s; and there, seated
at the table, occupied much as he had been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>studying, writing, and arranging papers, was the
father of the boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>His hair was very white, as white as silver, and
his face was beautiful and clearly cut. He had
an appearance of great age, and his tall figure was
thin and muscular. In some indescribable way he
reminded Rosalie of Mr. Barringcourt. A vague
fear began to spring in her mind—for in his dress
and manner there was something strangely reminiscent,
even though he looked so very old, with his
lined face and silver hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>But he used what Mr. Barringcourt had never used,
and that was a pair of glasses; and his glance was
very keen as he looked up at her above them with
bent brows. And whereas Mr. Barringcourt’s eyes
were as black as night, his were of a piercing blue,
or some colour very like blue. The quality that
struck Rosalie most was their intense brightness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The youth, having admitted her, withdrew, and
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are punctual, Rosalie, and I’m very pleased
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rose as he spoke, and drew a chair for her,
and on the hearing of his kind, grave voice much
peace and reassurance settled on her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I couldn’t help myself,” she answered. “I had
to come. But you can’t be half as pleased to see me
as I am to see you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at her. “Are you then so much in
need of a friend?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but I think I should make better friends
with your son than you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The vestige of a smile crept into his eyes. “But
why?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Well, I expect you will be too clever. You
would soon learn how stupid I was; and then
perhaps we should quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked up shyly as she spoke those last
words. The quarrelling, she felt pretty certain,
would be all on his side, as it had been with Mr.
Barringcourt, for she would never have presumed so
far.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You give Billy credit for being more forbearing
than I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no; I think he will be less observant. I’m
very stupid, you know,” she continued, with her
large, earnest eyes fixed on his; “and people get
very soon tired of me. I thought it might be just
as well to tell you now, in case you might form a
wrong impression, and then be annoyed after, and
blame me for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said he, smiling, “that will do for the
present. Sleep to-night, and in the morning we will
hold a longer conversation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it’s morning now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! It’s evening coming on. The sun has
set. No travellers ever come to us with morning.
The journey is too long for that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But everybody cannot come to you just at the
same time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, pretty much at the same time. We live in
the centre of a circle, and the distance from every
direction is fairly equal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you get many travellers?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not compared with many wayside inns. But we
have a select few that are always very welcome, for
we know that they possess some merit, or they would
never reach us.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Ah! Then I am afraid I am not equal to the
rest. I have no merits. Nothing but chance and
God’s goodness brought me to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled. “That is curious coupling,” he
answered. “Chance and God’s goodness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it was so extremely strange and unexpected.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We will speak more about it to-morrow. But
now I will come with you to see what light
refreshment our house affords.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rose from his chair and led the way into
another room where lamps were lit, though there was
still much light outside, and a clear fire burning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How stupid of me not to notice the sun was
setting. I thought when first I saw it it was
rising.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is a common mistake, much commoner
than you’d think, with those coming from Lucifram.
You see, it is the direct turnabout, and it is apt to
muddle one at first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed. What lovely flowers!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie was looking at the pretty supper-table and
its exquisite decorations. There was something so
pure and delicate and delicious about everything,
from the snowy linen and flowers all white and flaxen
coloured, to the china and vessels of silver and crystal
glass. Moreover, there was no shadow lying here.
One might eat in happiness and sweet contentment,
and the thankfulness born of these.</p>

<p class='c004'>And moreover, she did not sit down alone. Her
host took his place at the head of the small square
table, she to the side of him. Every dish was ready
served. But first he offered her a little glass of
purest sparkling water. Rosalie drank it. The
intense fatigue had vanished almost on the instant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>She made no effort to talk much, for he said
nothing, but ate her supper in silence. Then at
last he rose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will show you to your room,” he said. “Billy
has gone home; he only stayed to welcome you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought he was your son?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So he is. But this is not my home. It is but a
temporary lodging, conveniently situated for business
purposes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does no one else live here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one. You need not be afraid. I am sufficient
protection.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She followed him with trust and all simplicity to
the bedroom set for strangers. When she was alone,
by the light of two soft lights hanging from the
ceiling, she compared the pure white hangings with
the crimson silks at Marble House. Here, indeed, was
light-heartedness and freedom from all depression;
and with her head once on the pillow, she slept the
first genuine sleep of happiness for many a day.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Marble House lay swathed in the mist of early
morning. The sun had not yet risen, only that just
perceptible twilight that makes known the distant
approach of day was at hand. But one by one
various lights made their appearance in several
of the upper rooms. The occupants were rising
at their accustomed hour. It was close on six.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana also awoke, and with the first return of
consciousness came the consciousness of loss, vague
and alarming. When the light was turned on she
noticed the door leading to Rosalie’s room wide open,
and her own upon the passage standing closed but
for the catching of the clasp. Hurriedly she passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>into the inner room, to find, almost as she anticipated,
the bed unoccupied, its inmate gone. She went to
the dressing-room beyond. It also was empty.
Then turning back to her own room, she dressed
with a curious silent haste. A dull, murky grey
sky showed through the window. It caught
Mariana’s eye and intruded itself upon her
memory. Then when her toilette was completed
she went out into the corridor. There was no sign
of Rosalie either in the little sitting-room or
dining-room, and the truth forced itself undeniably
upon her. Rosalie had gone—escaped in the night.
But where? On second thoughts it seemed impossible.
Who ever yet escaped from Marble House
in Greensward Avenue upon the planet Lucifram?
She smiled forlornly to think of such a thing. And
then a sudden fear and trembling for the unhappy
girl came over her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had tried to escape and had been detected—must
have been detected. There were many cells
in the east wing, and to attempt to escape and fail
in it was of all crimes most criminal.</p>

<p class='c004'>A feeling, or the memory of a feeling, surged in her
heart, so cold, and even, and restricted. Like some
quick-gliding spirit she sought the staircase and
descended, finding Everard arranging a large batch
of papers on the table in the hall. He looked up at
her approach, and seeing the slight alteration in her
features and expression, said to himself, “It’s
Wednesday,” and went on with his work. But
the earnestness of her voice attracted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everard!” There was more in it than her usual
simple, even tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked up again.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“Everard! Where is Rosalie? Where have you
put her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie? I have not seen. Is she not upstairs?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is she in there? You have not put her in there?”
and pointed to the right-hand door.</p>

<p class='c004'>He shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She is nowhere of my putting or knowing. She
should be upstairs yet. Eight o’clock is her hour for
getting up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She is not there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not there?” He put the papers he held in his
hand down, and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. And nowhere else upon the corridor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you searched well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I did not like to wake the others. Do you
think she can possibly have got away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible! The doors are barred—and double
locked—and spring-locked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know. But where is she.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There must be a search instituted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank God the Master is away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He came home last night at midnight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice was grim as his information was short.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come home! Come home!” repeated Mariana.
“What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You had best go and tell him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he up?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. An hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t go. Do this thing for me, Everard. I
never asked you anything before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at her with a face half serious, half cold,
then turned in the direction of the west wing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana sat down on one of the many chairs—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>solitary figure in that big empty hall, with clasped
hands and shrinking form, fearing vaguely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Everard knocked at Mr. Barringcourt’s door, and
obeyed the summons to go in. Before Everard
could speak the Master looked up, and said, with a
pleasantness not always customary in him:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning, Everard! When Rosalie Paleaf
has had breakfast, I want you to see her. Don’t
forget to tell Mariana. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She has disappeared in the night!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who?” and the dark brows contracted slightly
as he looked across at the speaker.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie Paleaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Disappeared in the night? Tell fairy stories to
those that believe them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She is not in her bedroom, nor the corridor to
which she was restricted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who has told you this?” said the Master, getting
up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Confound Mariana! Go and search house and
gardens, and take the search-light, and bring her back
in half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Everard withdrew.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Disappeared!” said Mr. Barringcourt, left to
himself, and his brows came together blackly.
“That is impossible, without the help of Mariana,”
and then he turned to the letter he was writing and
finished it, though it was a long one, before Everard
returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>On his entrance the Master looked up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She is nowhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have searched in every place, likely and
unlikely?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“In every place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then a very cruel light leapt into his eyes, in that
deep shadow that encircled them, and his lips closed
one over the other grimly, as he looked across at the
doorkeeper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is to thank for this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was a circumstance quite unforeseen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t doubt it. Where is that heavy-sleeping
ass, whose snores swallow up footfalls and opening
doors?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean your first cousin for dulness of perception.
Send me that brainless thing called Mariana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Everard withdrew. He walked along the corridor
as evenly as usual. Whether doubt or misgiving was
in his mind, it showed nothing in his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>There, in the outer hall, scarcely having moved
during the whole time, sat Mariana. On the opening
of the door she looked up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Master wishes to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he very angry?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing but what may be appeased. But you
had better say no more than you can help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She got up without a word, and went to the
study.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is the girl I entrusted to you?” he said,
as soon as the door was closed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She has escaped during the night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At what time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Between ten and six.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The time is vague. You’re a sound sleeper to be
able to count eight hours of unconsciousness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I merit it by hard work during the day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! you should have explained this a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>earlier. If your work was too hard, others could
have been set to watch. Your excuse is admirable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is no excuse, it is the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You never heard a footfall, nor a door creak?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. The doors, as you know, have never
creaked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know nothing. You will perhaps enlighten me,
and not take too much for granted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can say nothing but in answer to your
questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you know nothing of the hour of escape?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know only that I saw her safely into bed last
night, looking utterly tired out. She fell asleep
almost before I left the room. This morning I found
the door leading from my room into hers standing
open, and that leading to the corridor off the latch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has she left anything behind her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I found her hat and cloak in the wardrobe; I do
not think she can have taken them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your deduction is beyond argument. A little
less sleep would stir that muddled, dreamy brain of
yours into some semblance, at least, of action.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think it’s the sleep that makes me stupid.
It’s the dull greyness of the sky.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe. What penalty are you inclined to pay
for your neglect and lack of vigilance?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was not neglect. I slept heavier than I have
ever slept before. I believe God helped her, for she
was young and good and innocent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You seem to entertain no sorrow for your neglect
of duty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her puzzled eyes, tired and questioning, met his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I do not feel sorry. How can I? She could
not settle to this prison life as I have done. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>was of a softer and more yielding nature. What
hardens me would soon have killed her altogether.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better be killed than get away alive without
permission. And you, being the offender, must bear
her punishment beside your own.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A wintry smile crept to her lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I am strong enough for any punishment.
I have a frame of iron buried in what seems like
flesh. If I have sinned, then name the punishment.
But sin at times, if sin this be, brings near an echo of
happier things beyond this life to conjure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are too hard-worked, you say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I said I slept the sounder for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sound sleeping is a thing for swine. You shall
not work so hard, for you must sleep less heavily.
You are intent upon a wedding-gown, I hear. Leave
it unfinished.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I have worked at it three years; the dullest
work is finished. This is the part I love, that makes
some compensation for that other thing I worship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And for the double punishment, seeing your
working hours have been reduced and cancelled,
there will be no further need for that night out—excruciating
torment for the all unhappy listeners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie loved my playing.” Her dark eyes
shone out from a face pale as death.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. She was bribing you to stop by flattery.
Did she not counsel you to give it up?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! that is impossible. I ask nothing but two
little hours a week. If that goes, I might as well be
dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You might then, for you have done with
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was the stipulation when I came here.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“You have broken the stipulation by your
carelessness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What am I to do, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing. Learn to appreciate the luxury of
idleness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have not weighed the fairness of such a
punishment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have angered me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give me but one hour a week, then. Give me
but one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not one! Get away out of my sight, lest I
be tempted to kick you out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where must I go? I have no place amongst the
others now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is the workroom. You had best guard
what you have made from moths. That is sufficient
occupation surely for one who hitherto was too hard-worked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a return to the life I led before I came here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The information does not interest me. You live
your life according to your own making. Go; I have
no more to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mariana’s eyes glittered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would I could appeal to some power without
against this cruel sentence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! there is no power without. The world is
too busy with its own affairs. You had best sink
into silence gracefully. You have got past the age
of screaming and past the age of tears. You have
let go the only prisoner I set my mind on keeping,
and need expect no mercy for it. Imbecile! Go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words were accompanied by an action so
indicative of savage irritation that Mariana, without
further reply, turned to the door and left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Daylight, unaccompanied by much warmth, had
taken the place of twilight. The lights were out,
and morning had begun.</p>

<p class='c004'>Along the corridor into the central hall, with face
all deathly white, she passed. She met Everard
there. He had waited for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>He read her untold story by her face, for she never
said a word, and glided past him like a ghost in a
painted picture toward the eastern wing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door swung open. Here no light had ever
penetrated by night or day, save only the artificial
glimmer and pale ghastliness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then at No. 13 she stopped, and opened the low-built
door. She gave one hurried glance back to the
big double door that shut her off from life, then
passed into the damp, dark cell, and closed the door
behind her.</p>

<p class='c004'>No longer the work that filled with a certain
pleasure the long hours of day. To sit there idle,
without light, or companionship, or occupation—that
was her doom now. And then, to give up that
precious pleasure and intoxicating dream that came
round once a week! She shuddered at the black
thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Down she sat upon one wooden chair. And as
she sat, the moths descended one by one about her.
But when she sighed they flew far off again. The
moths in flimsy clouds hovered above, and knew
quite all too well their time had not come yet.</p>

<p class='c004'>So there for the present we must leave her—stiff,
rigid, and unmoving. Crushed down by pain and
heaviness so great, she had no strength to move or
cry.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>THE GOVERNOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The morning came, and Rosalie awoke, light-hearted
and ready to arise. No one came here to call her
except the sun and singing birds outside the window.
None else were needed. When she had dressed, she
passed out on the landing and down the staircase,
and seeing the door open to the dining-room where
she had supped last night, went there. Its open
windows opened on the ground. Breakfast was laid
for two, and as none else was visible she passed out
into the garden, eagerly drinking in the wondrous
freshness of the morning air.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last she saw the stranger of the night coming
toward her from a gate in a high yew edge that
separated the garden from whatever lay beyond.
He carried a basket in his hand, and as he came
nearer Rosalie saw that the basket contained small
seeds. Though he wore glasses when writing in the
house, he evidently did not need them here. In fact,
it did not seem to her that a man with eyes so blue
and piercing could ever be short-sighted at all, but still
it must be so. He wore no hat. The sun shone on
his silver hair, a brilliant lustre. He walked with
ease and gracefulness, and again the odd resemblance
in appearance to Mr. Barringcourt recurred to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning, Rosalie! I think a spray of
flowers would greatly improve that sombre dress of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>yours. Gather what kind you like, and come to
breakfast—it is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He passed on as he spoke, and disappeared within
the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Following his advice, she gathered a cluster of pale
roses, and placed them in her belt. Truly, his words,
though simple, had had a very good effect. She no
longer felt she wore a uniform of black and red.
The flowers had given the happiest relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>After breakfast he invited her to his study, “for,”
said he, “I wish to have some conversation with you
before eight o’clock. After that I am engaged till
twelve, and rarely find much spare time till evening
has closed, and to-night I cannot spare you even
that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they were both seated there, he began the
conversation by saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Last night you told me you knew of no merit
that could have brought you to me, but I think that,
between us, we must endeavour to discover one.
Perhaps, if you will repeat your story to me, I may
be of use in finding it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So on that Rosalie recounted the story of her early
life, simply and truthfully, up to that last visit to the
temple. Nor did she omit her meeting with Mr.
Barringcourt there, and the short conversation she
had held with him. But on mentioning the last
visit, after her aunt’s death, she came to a sudden
stop, and seemed undecided and unknowing how to
proceed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You say you went once more inside the sacred
curtain. But why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I felt I had given up so much that the Serpent
must recognise how much I really loved him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Besides, I felt I wanted to get some real strength
to go on living after every hope and aspiration had
died away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was it made you wish so badly for a
tongue?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. I don’t think it was me that
wished; I think it was something else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then she flushed, for that was the style of
speech Mr. Barringcourt would have ridiculed. And
she herself recognised that truth at times, to the
ignorant or wilfully blind, may appear silly and
foolish. But this new acquaintance made no remark
immediately, only his keen eyes travelled across her
face, as if reading something there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that something?” he asked at length.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. But it never gave me
any peace, and it wasn’t myself, I am sure. Sometimes
I used to reason that I couldn’t possibly receive
the gift of speech, and yet the inner voice repeated,
‘Go on, go on!’ so that, apart from my own great
wish, I was obliged to do as I was told.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you received the gift at last?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“On that last visit to the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I—I—I—for that I went to Mr. Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent did not heal you, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, sir, could it?” Rosalie’s voice was almost a
remonstrance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is not the Serpent the God of Lucifram?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and that is what has troubled me so
heavily ever since; far more than imprisonment
and harshness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has troubled you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps if I tell you, you will think me fanciful.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>He smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fancies are all put to the test here,” he answered,
and a certain sternness rang in the kindness of his
tone that reassured Rosalie, somehow or other, when
she thought it would have frightened her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, after I had resigned my will, and prayed
for strength, I closed my eyes, and it seemed as if a
great vision flashed before me in the darkness. The
Serpent seemed to have turned round, and to show
that from the back it was all hollow, and in its three
tails, so black and dingy from the inside, three
dwarfed jesters sat, with caps and bells, all grinning
and pointing, as if to make a mock of everything.
And then a fire of purest light and radiance, with a
centre of unearthly brightness, more beautiful than
any sight I ever saw, rolled over everything, and
burnt the hollow symbol to a cinder with its
all-conquering strength.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s eyes were shining as they looked across
into his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And in my mind the same thing must have
happened. For somehow no longer I thought upon
the Serpent. All was changed. Whatever humble
love I had to give, and strength to ask, were
given and claimed by some wise reasoning Being
far above, whose faintest breath could shrivel into
cinders this grinning mockery worshipped of
man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What of the cinder?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I remember it never burned away. It
shone like a little ball of gold within the fire, and
I wondered at the time why it had never
disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly she got up and crossed the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and knelt down beside him, and clasped her hands
upon the arm-chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I believe it,” she said. “I could never
think of going back to the Serpent after the higher
thing; I loved to see the pure white light within
that glorious fire. It was so peaceful, restful, strong
and light-giving. I hardly think I could have spent
the week that followed, with all its brilliant lights
and gloomy blackness, and everything so fresh and
new, had I not had that light so pure and still to
think upon. It was divinest comfort to me even when
the blackness tried to quite obscure it, and set such a
terrible gap betwixt me and every living thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And after this you left the temple and went to
Mr. Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; there was nothing more to stay for. And I
think the same thing led me to him that has now
led me to you—calling ‘On! on! on!’ in spite of
everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And when you got there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then he healed me, by a very natural process it
seemed, that had little of the miracle about it. But
I felt no pain, and I remember he was very much
surprised at it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the cure was perfect?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I think it was too perfect. My tongue
became most glib and voluble. Words slipped
out I often wished unsaid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You had had no practice in restraining them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, no. But I think myself Mr. Barringcourt
really did oil the wheels of my tongue too freely,
because I don’t think by nature I should ever be
given to answering back. But when I was there
that seemed the one thing in life I was capable of.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>She had risen from her knees and walked towards
the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what reason should he have for doing
so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at him sideways. Then suddenly
she laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got to learn some day how intensely
stupid and simple I am, so perhaps you had better
know soon as late. Well, I think the reason why he
brought my tongue to such a pitch of volubility was
because he is very keen on finding out all secrets,
and he thought I should save time and trouble by
being made very talkative.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is keen on finding out secrets?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; it sounds silly, but it’s true. He was most
peculiar. If other men are like him, I pity the women
that have to deal with them, and often think how
fortunate my aunt was, for uncle was most quiet
and peaceable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your experience of people is not very great.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I could not tell whether he was like other
men or not. That’s how it was I felt at such a
disadvantage all the time. Anyway, he wasn’t like
any of my relations, the girls and women that
I knew, nor even like the doctor that attended us,
nor the bread baker, nor the butcher, nor any of
those. But then Everard wasn’t. None of them
were, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What led to your discovery of his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</span></i> for
secrets?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana told me; and when she told me, I
laughed to myself, it seemed so utterly ridiculous.
But afterwards I came to understand it. That is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>why he quarrelled with me, and left me a prisoner
in the upper storey.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In so short a time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. He found I had no secret worth
discovering.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But had you not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Sometimes I felt tempted to tell him the
real facts of my last visit to the temple, but
something always held me back. And after all, if I
had told him I should have become a prisoner all the
same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe. Then in the end you quarrelled with
him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, he quarrelled with me. We were getting on,
as I considered, very nicely, and suddenly I could
say nothing that would please him. Afterwards I
understood it was because he had grown tired of me,
and found me unprofitable, so far as secrets were
concerned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so you were consigned to shadows, and a
suite of rooms in an upper storey?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and it was terrible. I never wish to go
through such a time again. It seemed to me eternity.
Even now I don’t believe it was a week. It was a
year of weeks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did Mr. Barringcourt ever ask you any questions
about the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; he often asked me questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you never told him what you had seen
then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I couldn’t, much as I wanted to. When I
got to that part I only stammered, and that used to
make him angry.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then how can you say he discovered you had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>secret worth discovering when you distinctly had
one?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He would have simply ridiculed it, and said there
was no truth in it. So what was it worth to him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You used some little reason, then, in the controlling
of your tongue?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps it was I, but I gave the credit elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now we have to discover the merit that lit the
path for you to here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you not put on your glasses? It will be
hard to find.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long did you say you prayed to the Serpent
for the gift of speech?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Over two years; and the prayer was answered in
a different way from what I thought.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way, you spoke a little time ago of
Mariana. Who was she?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A kind of waiting-maid at Marble House. I do
not know what else she could be called, unless a
sewing-maid. But she was beautiful, and different
altogether from any sewing-maid that I had ever
seen. And even in a week I grew to love her, for
underneath a cold and smooth exterior she had the
sweetest, kindest disposition of anyone I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did she derive much happiness from living
there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“None, except two hours every Wednesday night.
And then she played upon a violin. I never heard
such music, though it was weirdly sad. But Mr.
Barringcourt blinded my reason to believe there was
no harmony in what she played.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You do not give him an enviable character.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is what I said when Mariana told me of
him.” And suddenly Rosalie shuddered. “How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>can I give him an enviable character when he was
cruel, hard as marble, and vindictive. He was bad,
really bad, and the worst thing is I knew it all the
time, yet had he been agreeable to me, really
agreeable, I would have shut my eyes to everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And from a very real feeling of shame, her colour
deepened, for Rosalie was not one of those people
who are blind to their own shortcomings and
weaknesses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly turning to her host, she said,
changing the conversation:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What must I call you? Everybody has a name,
but yours I never heard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” he answered slowly, “I don’t know that
for the present I have any name worth going by.
Some call me the Traveller’s Friend, some the
Physician, some the Task Master. You may call
me what you will for the present. Hereafter we may
find a better name.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Mr. Barringcourt was called the Master.
Suppose I call you the Governor, without any
abbreviation to a lesser name.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because Mariana told me I was weak, and weak
people want someone very strict with them, and I
should like to have a good understanding, you know,
because I’m very ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you will find me strict enough. And for
the rest, it’s bound to follow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he got up, and took down a large volume
from a book-shelf, and seated once more in his chair,
with the book on the table, adjusted his glasses, and
opening the leaves, turned them slowly, as one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>looking through the pages of a dictionary to
discover something.</p>

<p class='c004'>As last he found the place he needed, and for
some time read in silence; then closed the book
and instantly removed his glasses as he looked across
at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been through the list of merits, Rosalie, and
have decided yours is the questionable merit of
clinging on. None others have had much time to
develop yet. They may be there, no doubt, but have
not, as it were, yet come of age.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Clinging on! It’s very questionable, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but you’ll have one or two stiff examinations
to pass in it before you’ve finished.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—but the people who cling on are—are so
insufferable.” And it must be acknowledged a very
real tear of disappointment stood in her eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you have liked some higher-sounding
virtue?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I thought you were going to say meekness
and gentleness, or some of the great gifts of the
spirit. I never read that ‘clinging on’ was counted
much in the Book of Divine Inspiration. Besides,
who have I been clinging on to? I deserted the
Serpent just—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just at the right time. There is where the virtue
comes. Had you been any earlier you would have
shown great fickleness. Besides, after all, I don’t
think you’re very heavy, Rosalie. You would not be
such an insufferable load to drag along.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. But anyway, I’ll trust to
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well now, whilst you stay with me there is much
work to be done. But for to-day, until you become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>accustomed to your new surroundings, you may take
holiday. To-morrow morning be up as early as
to-day. After breakfast I will show you in what
direction your work will lie.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After that she went away, and saw no more of him
all day. It was an ideal holiday in the sun and
warmth and beauty of the outdoor life. And for the
noontide meal, Billy came and sat with her, though
he only drank one glass of water whilst she ate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you not hungry?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, yes. I’m getting hungry, but it isn’t my
meal-time yet. You’d be astonished if you saw the
amount I eat compared with you,” and he laughed in
the gayest, happiest tone. After a while he said:
“Have you made friends with the frog yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With whom?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The frog. My father’s pet frog. It is in the
garden, but is rather shy of strangers, but very
talkative when once you get to know it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A frog? And it can talk?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet! It has a better fund of words and
style of oratory than many a statesman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, it should be a human being.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy looked at her, and his brilliant sparkling eyes
were laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, no, hardly that. It is quite contented to
remain a frog—a very superior kind of frog.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you come every day for lessons?” asked
Rosalie, uncertain what to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three times a week. And the other days I walk
over in my spare time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you have not far to come?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not far, comparatively speaking. The distance
lessens as one grows older, I find.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Then it would be less to me than you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again he laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, no; I expect I’ve had more practice than
you. Good morning!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he was gone, leaving Rosalie to ponder on
that odd kind of powerful beauty in his face, and
that exuberant merriness that made her sigh to lose
him. For that was the worst of Billy. He seemed
to come and go more like some brilliant spirit, a kind
of Mercury, with winged heels, to bring one ray of
sunshine, and then depart.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <span class='large'>A PLANTATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The next morning after breakfast the Governor led
her down the garden to the gate in the edge of yew.
He carried in his hand the basket she had seen the
day before, containing seeds. But whereas yesterday
they had looked green, to-day they had a silvery-white
appearance, toning to a liquid aspect as of
water in the centre. Beyond the edge stretched a
square plot of uncultivated land bordered by willow
trees, and at the further side a little hut of wood,
just in the shelter of the forest. But here the sun
did not shine so brightly. The garden of Pleasure
was left behind. This was the field of <em>Work</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Governor led the way across to the hut. It
consisted of two rooms, a living- and a sleeping-room,
and moreover a little cellar, where she discovered all
kinds of garden implements and spades, and one
large fork that looked as if it were for digging heavy
soil.</p>

<p class='c004'>He put the basket down upon the table, and then
he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is your little house. These are the seeds to
be sown in the strip of land you see without. You
must dig and sow, and then wait for the harvest.
The books upon the shelves you may study in your
leisure, but you must grasp each subject thoroughly
before your time of apprenticeship is over.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>So saying, without any word of advice or caution
he left the hut and crossed to the gate that led to the
garden. Rosalie was left alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>But though on one side lay a great and unknown
forest, she experienced no fear at being left alone,
even though when she looked out she noticed how
uncompromisingly high the edge appeared, shutting
her quite away from sight or sound of the pretty
wayside house.</p>

<p class='c004'>But just then a voice attracted her attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well! well!” said it, most harshly, “what’s the
first thing that a farmer does before he sows his
seed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” answered Rosalie; “I’ve
never lived in the country,” and looked round to find
the speaker.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there on the doorstep was a frog sitting,
looking up at her half contemplatively, half pityingly.
Its colours were beautifully striped, green and white.
On its head these colours blended brilliantly, taking
away some of the staring effect of the wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t know?” it answered. “Well! well!
You’ll have to dig. Get a fork and dig. Well!
well! best to know nothing than to know too
much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie went as she was told, and brought the big
fork she had noticed. It certainly was very big, and
looked aggressive.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What else should I mean? Now then, set to
work. The quicker you begin, the quicker you’ll
finish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—but what must I do with it?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Grasp it in both hands. Stick it in the ground,
and push it in with your foot. Well! well! the
sooner you learn, the sooner you’ll know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t!” said Rosalie. “It’s a man’s work;
why, it’s digging. I know I was never intended
to do that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The frog, by way of showing its disgust, gave a
contemptuous croak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Man’s work? It isn’t the work most men would
thank you for giving them. Even as far back as the
days of Divine Inspiration mankind was ashamed of
it. It’s woman’s work! What man won’t do always
falls to the woman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But women never dig in our country,” said
Rosalie, still bent on the argument.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What country’s yours?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The biggest in the whole of Lucifram.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would be bigger still if the women applied
themselves better,” said the frog, and a short silence
followed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you really think I ought to do it?” said
Rosalie, at last, not being of that stubborn nature
that delights in saying “no” and sticking to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I don’t see what else is to be done,” said
her companion. “If you don’t dig you’ll never sow,
and if you don’t sow, you’ll never reap, and if you
don’t reap you’ll never—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Prove you’re anything but a fool.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Really?” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Really!” said the frog; but the expression in
each voice was different.</p>

<p class='c004'>So she stuck the fork into the ground, and found
it took a great deal of strength to make any impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>upon the surface. But once having put her
shoulder to the plough, as it were, there was nothing
for it but to go on, for the old voice kept ringing
“Go on! go on!” and consequently on she went.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frog, for some considerable period, watched
her from the side, but finally hopped away into the
hut. At noonday it appeared again, and summoned
her to dinner, which was already prepared in the
little living-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who prepared my dinner?” asked Rosalie, after
she had washed her hands and settled to the meal.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did,” it replied. “It’s a woman’s work certainly,
but if you waited for a woman to do it for you, you’d
come badly off. No; I’m a frog, but when there’s no
one else by I can do other work besides my own.
How do you like digging?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It makes me very tired, and the inside of my
hands are quite sore.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are they? Well, you’ve got to go on again this
afternoon, you know. If you don’t get the seeds in
before very long they’ll wither.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She answered nothing, but after the customary
hour of rest returned again to the hard labour.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was slow work and very hard, and not a soul
came near all the day long. In fact, during the
afternoon even the frog seemed to have deserted her,
and it was not till the first faint tinge of evening
crossed the sky that she again heard the familiar
voice calling from the wooden doorstep:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Time’s up now; tea’s ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie let the fork drop on the ground, and turned
round as eagerly as her tired body would allow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whilst she ate her tea, this new friend sat upon
the hearth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“I shall be as stiff as a board to-morrow,” said
Rosalie, laying her tired arms upon the arms of the
chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; my master sent down that little bottle on
the mantelpiece for you. You must take it before
you go to bed, and you will be all right in the
morning—so far as stiffness is concerned, anyway.
We don’t go in for torture here, but we believe in
hard work—very hard work sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When the meal was finished the frog said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, if you will take this arm-chair by the
fireplace, I will remove the table.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did so, and was surprised to see that when
the frog pulled a small knob in the wall the whole
table, which, however, was not large, disappeared
through an opening partition, and left the room
clear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you want to read or study, you must draw
that writing-desk nearer,” continued her instructor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to do anything to-night. I’m so
tired, I think I’ll go to bed early.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That wouldn’t be a bad plan, seeing you have
only been at work one day, and find it all so strange.
You’ll be more accustomed to it to-morrow, and get
more done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Rosalie; “I’m all impatience to be
finished. It is such dreary work, and I’m quite
inquisitive about the seeds. I wonder whether
they’ll grow up roses, or lilies, or nasturtiums, or
dahlias, or hyacinths, or chrysanthemums, or what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you know much about seeds?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing. Uncle was very clever that way; but
I never cared about seeds—they looked so very
uninteresting; I only cared about the flowers.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“If I were you,” said the frog, “I would rub a
little of that liquid out of the bottle on my hands.
If they are blistered and sore it will heal them very
quickly. I’ve had sore hands myself, so I can
sympathise. And here’s a pair of gloves,” it continued,
drawing a pair from behind the coal-scuttle.
“I made them this afternoon, instead of coming out
to keep you company. I might have made them
outside, but I thought it would be a little surprise
for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, thank you,” said Rosalie. “How very
thoughtful of you! Where did you learn everything
you know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well! well!” said the frog, with quite a sorrowful
croak, “I learnt it in the school where it is most
generally taught.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where was that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the school of experience and adversity, for the
most part.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you think that people can be kind unless
they’ve gone through a great deal of suffering?”
asked Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now and again, just now and again, one finds
them. But they’re few and far between.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think suffering and trouble make people bitter,
or else break them up altogether.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not if they’re made of the right stuff,” said the
frog. “It’s the needle’s eye that rich and poor men
alike have to pass through. If you can’t stand
sorrow, you can’t stand happiness, though you may
think you can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we were made to be happy. The Serpent—God
rather, meant us to be so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God meant us to be happy eventually,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>frog gently. “But like all things else worth having,
it takes a great deal of fighting for. Contentment
and peace are the nearest approach to it one
generally gets the other side of heaven.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like the word ‘peace.’ It reminds me of
a fat woman, and a dinner of suet dumplings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re prejudiced, or else you’ve mistaken it for
lethargy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, is not contentment a state of lethargy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; when you’re most contented, you’re least
so. The two things naturally go together, and keep
up a constant flow of action that does away with
torpidness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long do you think it will be before my work
is finished here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. It’s rather a foolish question to
ask. No one knows. It depends upon what time
the seed takes to ripen and the bent of your
mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And in the evenings must I study?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is your only time. But what you want is
plenty of hard work and plenty of deep thought.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that is almost everything,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe it is,” answered the frog; and by the
simple process of pulling another knob emptied a
shovelful of coal on the fire out of the chimney-side.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not long after this when Rosalie prepared
for bed. She rubbed the liquid on her hands, and
found it very soon relieved them. Then she drank
the contents of the bottle and retired to the inner
room, first bidding the frog “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sleep on the doorstep,” said it, “so you may
sleep doubly secure. Nothing evil can cross me, for
my life is charmed.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>And, somehow or other, there seemed more life,
strength, and independence in this small creature
than there had ever been in Mariana. Poor Mariana!
Rosalie fell asleep thinking of her, wondering how
she had taken the news of her escape, and whether
Mr. Barringcourt indulged in anything further than
a frown when the truth was told to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But these thoughts did not keep her long out of
the land of dreams. Perhaps it was that Rosalie had
enough to do thinking of her own affairs just then.
It never struck her that her escape could make any
material difference to Mariana. She imagined her
living the same even life, with one real pleasure in
the week in compensation for its darkness, and saw
within her mind the wedding-dress nearing completion,
and trembled in her sleep to think it soon
must be finished and fade again to nothing for want
of one to wear it.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in the night she dreamt the seeds were sown,
the time of harvest came, and every seed appeared
as a huge and barren stone. Then in despair and
disappointment she wept upon them, and they
disappeared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <span class='large'>SEEDS GROWING CONTRARIWISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>After that, life began in earnest for Rosalie. For
some weeks her days were given to digging, her
nights to mastering the alphabet of some unknown
language. It was all dry work, and very hard.</p>

<p class='c004'>No one came near, except the frog, and she often
found herself wishing for more human companionship.
But still it was not Rosalie’s nature to
grumble too much at circumstances. She contented
herself with an occasional sigh, and for the rest learnt
to love the harsh, croaking voice that had something
to say about most things, and was always kind
enough to revive her drooping spirits with cheering
words.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the plot of ground was all prepared, and
considering it had been digged by a woman, it was
not at all badly done. No one would have known
the difference if they hadn’t been told, though afterwards
they might have discovered the depth was not
so great. However that may be, the seeds were
sown in it, and began doubtless to do their own little
bit of digging, and go down so far that no one could
find them where they’d first been put. After the
sowing came the time of waiting. There was much
weeding, and more watering, for no drop of rain
ever descended there, and all had to be carried from
a stream near by.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Rosalie watched the ground impatiently to see
when the first bright blade would appear, but though
she waited one month, two, three, four, nothing at
all except an occasional weed altered the surface of
the ground. And her whole heart was buried in
that little garden. It seemed as if it, too, must have
taken root down there, away from the sunshine and
the warmth.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the waiting was far worse than the working,
for after three months certainly something ought to
have shown. But when it went on to four, five, nay,
at last came out into six long months, and nothing
yet had come to light, Rosalie went back into the
little hut, and laid her head upon her arms upon the
table, and cried from sheer disappointment and low
spirits. For during this time of waiting and subsequent
doubt no one had come to see her, no one at
all, except the frog.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this fit of depression, which was the first of
its kind, the outcome of disappointment and hope
deferred, the frog spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, Rosalie? I’ve never seen you cry
before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t stand it any longer, I know I can’t. I’ve
waited for six months, with never a soul to speak to
but you, and nothing has come up. It’s all a failure.
My heart is as heavy as a stone. If it gets much
worse it will break right in two. I know it will.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is your heart?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It should be in my body, but I believe I must
have sown it along with the seeds in the garden, and
it’s turning to stone while they’re rotting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the frog spoke rather shyly, as one who fears
to be ridiculed, and is slightly apologetic.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Perhaps the seeds have turned to—to—to—stone,
too,” and it looked hard in the fire instead of at
Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>She, however, looked across at it with eyes wide
open.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, really! It doesn’t seem unlikely, considering
the time they are in coming up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What will you do?” said the frog.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll begin to dig again,” cried Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the wisest thing you’ve said since you came
here,” the frog answered, and its colours flashed quite
brilliantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>So the next morning (for it was evening when
they spoke to one another) Rosalie rose with a much
lighter heart than for some time past, went out into
the garden with the fork, and began to dig. She
dug all day, but found nothing, till just at eventide
she noticed something shining in the dull, damp soil.
She picked it out with her fingers very eagerly. It
was a dull enough looking stone for the most part,
with here and there a substance in it that shone like
glass—not very brilliantly. Whatever it was, it was
enough to brighten Rosalie’s spirits for the time
being, and as just then she heard the frog’s voice
calling her to tea, she made as much haste forwards
as she could over the clodding soil to show her
treasure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See what a beautiful thing I have found!” she
cried, and held it up triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t very brilliant,” said the frog, looking at it
critically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. You do, because you’ve been looking at black
soil all the day, but I’ve been looking at the sun.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Well, but then the brightest thing would look
dull if you compared it with the sun. How am I to
find out really what it is?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take it to my master.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t open the gate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The gate will open of itself, if you’ve anything to
take to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie turned about to run off at once, but the
other said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait and have tea first. He is never at liberty
till six, and now it’s only five.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So after tea, Rosalie, having previously changed
her heavy boots and generally tidied herself, set off
in the direction of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gate this time responded easily enough to her
hand, and soon she was walking through the garden,
holding her stone the tighter, in that she was quite
sure, from the fact of the gate opening so readily, it
must be worth something very considerable.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door leading into the garden was open, and
after knocking she passed through, and went at once
to the study.</p>

<p class='c004'>The curious thing about the sun here was that it
always set at the same time of day, and that between
five and half-past, so that now twilight had fallen,
and the lamps were lit, though the blinds remained
undrawn.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Governor sat as usual, and must have been
expecting her, for he held out his hand as she entered,
saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what have you brought?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She placed it in the hand he held out, and waited
whilst he looked at it. This did not take very long,
for almost on the instant he looked up, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“I’ll send it to an expert in the city of Lucifram,
and get his opinion on it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think it is very valuable, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid I don’t, except in a way that doesn’t
count. But we’ll send it to someone who is unacquainted
with the digging, and watering, and heartburning
it has necessitated, and therefore who will
be less prejudiced than I.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When will you send it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night; and you will hear the decision in
something like a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So then she went away. The next two weeks
were passed in waiting, and in the study of those
books which Rosalie found more dry and difficult
each succeeding day. For there was no one to
explain them, and in some parts there seemed nothing
but big full-stops and commas, with wide gaps
between.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at the end of that time the frog came to her
one morning and said the Governor wished to see
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie went in fear and expectation, and the first
thing her eyes lighted on was her stone upon the
table. This, she felt, was not quite as it should be.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The decision is that it is rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That was all the Governor said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She felt rather miserable. She thought it must be
with hurrying across the garden. However, there
was nothing to be said, and Rosalie withdrew. After
that some very hard, frosty weather followed, and the
ground was so hard that for a long time she was able
to do nothing—outside, at any rate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then when it thawed a little she went out and
digged again, and found just such another stone as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the one before, only of a little lighter and brighter
substance.</p>

<p class='c004'>After tea she took it to the Governor, as last time.
He promised to send it to the city, and get the
opinion of an expert upon it. Rosalie withdrew to
wait. At the end of a fortnight she was again sent
for to the Governor’s house. Her stone was on the
table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The decision is that it is rubbish,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>And she felt disappointed this time, but not miserable.
One is never quite so sure of things after the first
time—that is, if they’ve miscarried. She went back
again to the plantation and the hut. Again the
ground had frozen, and for some time it was impossible
to do anything, even had she had the inclination.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this, every time the thaw came Rosalie set
to work again, finding the work a change and relief
from study. And though the disappointment always
lasted out the frost, it always disappeared with the
thaw. And every time she went up to the house,
the particular stone she had last found lay on the
table, and the words were:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The decision is that it is rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This went on for a long while, till at last it seemed
to Rosalie all the hope had been crushed out of her,
and she went back to the garden and found it quite
frosted over. But after a while the frost broke, and
the frog, seeing Rosalie made no attempt to go to
dig, said to her:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The frost has broken.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you not go out into the garden?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I’m too impatient. I want the seeds to
grow quicker than I can learn. I’ve been thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>about it all, and I feel that I must wait. Bright
stones take longer to grow than flowers, because they
fade less quickly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Thereupon the frog let fall a tear of gratitude,
but turned the other way during the odd process, so
that Rosalie never noticed it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then followed a very long and dreary time, with no
companionship; nothing but the even days and dull
books, and the sympathetic frog. And this went on
so long that many a time Rosalie went out to look at
the ground, and sighed, but never thought of touching
it, because something had said “Stand still.” At
last, after a very long time had gone by, she went to
bed one night, feeling particularly sad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some hours later she awoke to find the moon
shining full into the chamber. She got up and
dressed, and went through into the outer room. The
door was open, and the frog was sitting contemplatively
upon the step, looking out on to the beauties
of the night. Occasionally it gave a croak of
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie went to the cellar and brought out the
big fork, and thought she was so quiet the frog had
never seen her. But then, poor thing, its eyes were
so large, they stared out from every side of its head,
and as she approached the door it hopped down, and
moved aside to let her pass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t you ask me what I’m going to do?”
she said, laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s plain to be seen,” it answered, and hopped
after her in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Rosalie began to dig, just on that
portion of ground where a shaft of moonlight
had fallen. For some time nothing but loose soil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>came up, but at last the fork hit upon something
hard. It did not move till a space had been cleared
all round it, and then it appeared nothing but a
heavy hard mass of black earth, with an irregular
surface.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” said the frog.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are other tools in the cellar beside a fork,”
said she. “But we’ve done enough for one night. It
can stay now till the morning,” and she took it in
both hands, and lifted it out of the deep trench dug
about it.</p>

<p class='c004'>So then once more night reigned undisturbed.
But with the morning work began again, this time
with finer instruments to chip away the thick layers
of soil and find what lay beneath. It took a very
long time, much longer than Rosalie ever anticipated,
though in other ways the hours passed quickly under
this keen absorption. In many places the soil seemed
more like marble than rock, and required much
patience to remove it, for none of the instruments
were particularly sharp, nor specially adapted for
that purpose. But what of that? Working, working,
ever unceasingly, on went Rosalie, and one
day she looked up at the frog, and half laughed,
and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe my heart is inside here, and I’ll never
be happy till it’s free, quite free.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the frog only turned away and sighed, and
Rosalie was so intent that she never heard the sigh.</p>

<p class='c004'>And at last!</p>

<p class='c004'>Bit by bit a brilliant jewel unfolded itself, all
flashing green-and-moonlight colour, and with one
gleam of ruby red, just one bright gleam upon the
middle surface.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>And she pressed it to her lips and kissed it. This
was no dull stone with intermittent flashes of light.
No, this was <em>real</em>—a lovely thing of sparkling colour.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was finished just at sunset. She scarcely needed
any tea, so eager and impatient was she to get away.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then she appeared before the Governor with
this precious prize.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve found something really, at last,” said she,
with bright eyes and cheeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>As of old he held his hand out for it, but said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t you speak?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not for me to speak,” he answered; and so
she went away.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie was scarce content with waiting now.
She doubted not that all would see the value of the
stone she had so lately found, and most of all an
expert. And indeed there seemed to be no time
for waiting. The voice said, “Go on.” Truly the
harvest was beginning. Who would sit down with
but one sheaf tied?</p>

<p class='c004'>And she was justified in doing so. Another lump
of hard black earth (to be chipped away slowly and
surely) appeared amongst the looser soil. And after
a time the under surface partly appeared, and it, too,
as far as she could see, was bright and brilliant.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as this was in process the message arrived at
breakfast, the Governor wished to see her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not allow herself to think, because she
dare not, but whatever thought rose in her mind it
was success.</p>

<p class='c004'>She knocked at the study door and entered. There,
in the same place that all the others had been in turn,
lay the shining jewel, and the cold voice answered:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“The decision is that it is rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The pain within was so great that Rosalie could
have screamed, and then came sickness and faintness,
so that she leant against the door and looked at
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does it mean?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is accounted of no worth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, but it is! it is!” she cried, and looked at him
so hard that he looked back at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have told you the decision.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what do <em>you</em> say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what is wrong with it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe the decision was that it was gaudy. It
shone too much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him dully, and then turned and went
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>There in the plantation was the work she was
engaged on. Her eyes were too dull to see the sparkle
of light, her heart too black to care. And suddenly
she laughed, and picking up the fork lying near,
began to dig again. The frog sat by and watched.</p>

<p class='c004'>In furious haste, without apparent thought, she
worked, and at last came upon a much smaller mound,
containing one much smaller stone of transparent
substance that had no lustre at all. But bitter tears
were running fast from her swollen eyes, and two of
them flashed on it. When she tried to rub them off
upon her sleeve they seemed quite hardened, and
they never moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is this gaudy?” she asked, turning suddenly to
her companion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think so,” it answered meekly. And then
she sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“It seems to me it’s hardly bright enough, except
the tears.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And in the evening she went with it again to the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c004'>After that the time was very short till she was
again summoned to the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there the lesser jewel lay, just as she had
brought it, and the decision was once more that this
was rubbish also.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she turned to him, and cried bitterly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You gave me the seeds—what is wrong with
them? I cannot alter them from what they are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps it would be best if now you left the
garden,” he answered slowly, “seeing it is so
profitless.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But she looked at him with straining eyes, and
answered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t. It’s the work I have been put to do, and
I must finish it. I told the frog I thought my heart
was in that first hard mound, and I believe it is.
But there’s something else beside my heart, and
that’s there too, and I’ll never be free till it is free.
And what can I do? I am mad. I see things
beautiful that others only stare at, and then pass by
with scarcely one comment. And the old cruel
voice keeps crying, ‘Go on! go on!’ and whither
can I go? The path is all so black that, forward or
backward, I am lost whichever way I turn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then because he did not answer, she said at last:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Send it, the first I brought to you, that brilliant
moonstone, to some other place. The man who
called it rubbish can’t have any eyes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just as you like,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she went away.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>In the plantation there had set so hard a frost
that everything was white and stiff and ice-bound.
There lay the half-chipped mound containing the
other jewel scarce yet visible. But Rosalie had no
heart to touch it, even had the frost allowed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>And no result came from sending the moonstone
to another place. One general and unanimous
opinion: it had no value—that was all. And still
for months the blighting frost lay dead on everything.</p>

<p class='c004'>In vain, with burning fever under the outward chill
that froze her too, did Rosalie take the fork and try
with what little strength was in her arms to break
the iron earth. Nothing moved. It only made her
recognise the more the great impossibility, the
strength of life imprisoned by the frozen hands of
death.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last (for now the gate within the edge was
never fast) she went again to the Governor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What am I to do?” she asked. “I can’t get on
with anything, nor move either way. I’ve prayed to
God a thousand times to give me peace or break the
ice, or let me get the price of freedom from that
jewel which I brought to you, and nothing ever
answers, except in contradiction. I prayed one
night the thaw might come—a hundred times and
more I prayed it. In the morning a double frost
had settled, petrifying hard as iron. Another night
I prayed for peace and rest. I could not stand so
terrible a strain. I never dreamt as that night.
Ten times I dozed and woke again, covered with
sweat, all shivering in the cold, to think myself alive
within a coffin, buried within the ground. And most
incessantly that other prayer to reap the price of
freedom with the stone, and as you know, it lies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>here in your keeping—a useless thing, and judged
devoid of worth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You say your heart is in the stone,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I think it sends out shafts of brilliancy to
pierce to that dull, empty place, and prick it into
fearful pain. What can I do? I’ve prayed to God—what
more can I do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is one thing more. You’d better give it
up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! but that is everything—the whole of the
little garden. For the frost will never break till the
stone is free, and I.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can give the garden back to God who gave
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why give me a thing and take it back just
when it’s fit for using?” and then a great pain
and fear came into her eyes. “I would do as
you tell me, I would really, but I haven’t the
strength, and I’m afraid. The frost is too strong
for me. It freezes my heart, and leaves my mind
quite free, so that the blood courses through my
brain in quickest time, and then stops suddenly.
It’s worse than killing me. I’m going mad, and
what use am I to God, or how can I see the light
of heaven, if once that heavy cloud descends, and
coupled with the frost, freezes upon my eyes and
lips, and eats out everything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To trust in God is to be sane—have peace,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, peace!” she answered greedily. “What
does it mean? I know no peace—nothing but the
mocking, cruel voice that says ‘Go on!’ and shows
no way.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“It’s the stone, Rosalie, that stands in your light,
and blocks the way. Can’t you see it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I expect I’m very blind. I’m not clever enough
to understand. I haven’t spirit enough to find a way
out. Mr. Barringcourt told me so, and he knew best.
I was handicapped from the beginning to be born
without a tongue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that difficulty, and still another, has been
surmounted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but I did nothing myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fiddlesticks!” said the Governor, and he spoke
so naturally that Rosalie laughed, even though not
particularly brightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I didn’t do much myself. I don’t see how
I could.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You did as much as was necessary, which is
never in any case very much; and now there is one
little thing more to be done—give it up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I dare not,” she said; “it would send me mad.
If it would kill me I wouldn’t mind.” And she
looked down to hide the light in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give it up to God. Do you trust God and think
He will forsake you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; it’s myself I am not sure of.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should be part of God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where else, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In heaven.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It begins on earth for those of sufficient intelligence;
and for the others, they do not count.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m one of the last, then. It is so hard, so very,
very hard, and I have no strength at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then a very long silence followed—the terrible
fight between weakness and trust, between blind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>ignorance and all-conquering wisdom, the spirit’s
humble discipline; and at last she turned to him,
and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll give it up! And if I sacrifice my heart or
head, it’s all the same, seeing God is the receiver,
and He knows best.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then she turned away, with the knowledge of
having done some duty that now seemed extremely
simple.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Governor rose from his chair, and came
towards her, and took her in his arms, and kissed her
cheek, and the caressing action reminded her somehow
of that time long ago, when Mr. Barringcourt
laid his hand upon her shoulder in the temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bur that kiss seemed to revive her strength, and
give some of that peace she had so lately craved
for.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet this reward was so very unexpected. It never
occurred to her that the Governor could possibly care
whether she walked right or wrong, except, perhaps,
as a spectator. But the magnetic sympathy of that
kiss, and the great, but gentle, strength in his arms
as he drew her to him, awoke her eyes to the fact
that here was her friend, the only one she had ever
known, maybe would ever meet.</p>

<p class='c004'>But being too full of feeling for words she slipped
quietly towards the door, and crossed the lawn
towards the hut.</p>

<p class='c004'>That was her little home, to be filled with
contentment and happiness, in which it would be
her task to dig graves for bitterness, repining, and
wild craving and longing for that which was not
to be. It would be a hard task. Rosalie recognised
it as she looked at the frozen mounds of soil, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>digging had occasioned so much eagerness and
anticipation.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in her mind she looked below the frozen
surface of the plantation to where other jewels all
lay buried, and she had given them up to God, and
they must lie there.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the kiss and the strength of those strong arms
had worked a miracle for her. She no longer felt
the weak restlessness and alternate blackness of
despair and madness. She went into the little
hut bravely, with tears trembling on her eyelids,
partly the outcome of the struggle she had gone
through, and partly of a vague sense of happiness
and satisfaction that was beginning to glow within,
like some glowing light of summer. Later she said
to her companion:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was a man who healed my tongue for me,
healed it with light, and now I think my heart is
being healed, and it is still Light, Light, Light, on
the poisonous darkness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you have given up the moonstone. It was
a dangerous stone. I like the little tear-stained one
the best.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I love it too,” said Rosalie. “It gave me
work to do at the time I most needed it, and set my
mind on the road it has travelled ever since.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she took down the lesson-books, and found
to-night they were much more understandable, and
it was with growing lightness of spirit that she slept
that evening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <span class='large'>A HUMBLE CRUCIFIXION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The next morning sunshine and warmth had come,
the frost risen and fled. The birds were singing
in the forest, and the melting icicles had none of
the dispiriting effect of thaw, but sparkled in the
sunshine. The ground was free.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie went out and took the fork and began the
old process—digging. It took a long, long time,
days, and weeks, and months, to chip away the soil
from the new mound.</p>

<p class='c004'>And at last the first bright ray—uncheckered—burst
through. Rosalie started up with a cry. The
frog hopped up to witness. Both of them shed a
tear of joy and admiration that glistened like a pearl,
though dull beside this other. At last a gem of
purest brightness was displayed, that shone with so
soft a radiance, yet so pure and bright, that it lit up
the garden like the bright sun on an early summer’s
morning, and seemed a dazzling emblem of light.</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie said: “This is the light which cures
as well as beautifies—the talisman against all ills—the
gift of God, the pearl above all price; never pearl
shone like to it, or diamond, or ruby, or any stone
dug from the mines or caves. I’ll take it to the
Governor. None can fail but to acknowledge its
beauty, if but for the one central spark from the
raised inner surface.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>And she took it to him, but as she offered it, said
nothing, and he showed no surprise, but smiled
gravely, as one who might approve in silence, but
said no words.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Rosalie waited, and in a shorter time than she
had ever stayed before, less than a week, was sent
for by the Governor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flashing jewel was on the table by his side.
He looked across at her, but her eyes were fixed
upon the stone. So soon, and it was back! And
the time it had taken to dig! and the long months
of blackness before! And at last her eyes travelled
slowly from it back to his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he said with curious intonation: “The
decision is the same as hitherto.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But God’s decision! Tell me that!” and the
pain in her voice was very terrible.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The decision of God is that it is as He has made
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is sufficient. Thank you,” and she moved
away; strong only in the friendship of that silent
man, who in so few words conveyed so much of
meaning.</p>

<p class='c004'>So once more she made her way to the little hut,
where the frog as usual sat waiting; but her lips were
set in a smile so stony, that she said never a word,
but sat down in her chair by the fire, and forgot to
try to form even a syllable.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last her eyes lighted on the frog sitting there
upon the hearth. Its big, wide, mournful mouth
drooped at the corners, and its round saucer eyes
were brimming with tears, yet there was something
very comic in its attitude—so much so that Rosalie
laughed. At this it jumped so literally that had it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>not borne a charmed life it would certainly have
settled in the fire, but as it was, it came down inside
the fender, and then hopped out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! when you laugh in sorrow your heart must
needs be broken altogether,” it said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! I feel nothing, nothing at all, one way or
the other, only hard and empty, and sorry, not for
myself, but for others, that they should be so blind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s well you feel hard. It doesn’t do to feel soft
at times like this,” said the frog, and tried to speak
cheerfully, but somehow failed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside a white mist was settling, so silently that
they never noticed it. But just then the frog piled
more coal on the fire, and soon the room looked very
cheerful.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come and sit on my knee,” said Rosalie presently;
and she almost laughed again at the rapidity with
which her request was granted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although they had lived together so long, this was,
as it were, the first time she had seen the frog close.</p>

<p class='c004'>She took one of its little feet in her fingers, and
noticed it was pierced with a hole. Then in turn she
looked at each foot separately, and found the same
mark in each.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you come by these? They look as if
they must have been very painful at one time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was very stupid of me,” said the frog shyly.
“Generally I put a jewel into each, and everyone
remarks about my pretty feet, but to-day, with
thinking about your affairs, I forgot. It was most
negligent of me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you get the jewels from?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My master said I found them by myself, but I
think he really gave them to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“But tell me about these holes, unless you’d rather
not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a short and very common story,” it answered
evasively; “I don’t think it would interest you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed it would; you have been so kind to me
all along that I know you won’t deny me this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, there was a time when I used to be a very
ordinary little frog, jumping about, and eating all
that I could get. And I was very vain of my
appearance, for I knew that my coat was brighter
than any of my neighbours, and I wished them to
know it too. But I wasn’t content with being
admired by my own kith and kin; I thought I
should like to gain the admiration of mankind as
well. Instead of confining myself to the shrubs
and well in the garden, I contrived to make myself
plainly seen by hopping about the paths. There
were no children in the house adjoining, so that I
felt doubly safe, for the two servant maids used to
walk in the garden often at dusk, and talk about
their sweethearts, and at these times they always
found a kind and flattering word for me. Meeting
with such kind treatment from them, I grew doubly
proud, and formed the erroneous idea that all
mankind was equally kind and simple. I made no
doubt that had I been taken before the Queen,
my manners, colour, and deportment would have
astonished her, and called forth her admiration.
As discontentment had first grown toward my own
people, so at last it grew towards the maid-servants.
I wanted more than two admirers, and almost lost
my brilliant colour pining for them. About this
time, however, my old mother died, and what with
the nursing of her, and seeing to her respectable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>removal afterwards, I had little time for thinking of
myself. But when things had settled themselves
again, my old longing revived. I must go out
along the paths again and try to gain more
admiration.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, there lived in that house a man. He always
wore spectacles, and whenever he walked in the
garden always carried a book, and from what I
could gather from the maids’ conversation, was really
very clever. Now, being myself very ignorant, I
naturally admired clever people, and a great longing
grew in my mind to gain his approbation and
attention. So whenever he walked out in the
garden, I watched my opportunity, and hopped
along the path beside him. But for a long time
he either never noticed me, or if he did do so, was
never attracted by my charms. This upset me so
much that my health became visibly enfeebled. I
felt that if he could but see it, I might become of
value in his eyes, and thus raise myself in his good
graces and esteem. Still, I felt I could not give in,
for I had a friend of somewhat duller coat always
watching me, ready to say upon the first occasion:
‘I told you so.’ So I continued hopping by his side
in these walks, which, of late, had become habitual.
But one day, as he came down the path, he closed
his book, and his eyes suddenly lighted on me. I
know not what the expression in them was, but my
vanity took it favourably. I sat there as still as a
frog can sit, because I had heard it was a sign of
good breeding to sit still, and pretended to be gazing
at the sun, because I thought it would appear good
taste to admire a thing so generally esteemed. And
he stood still too, but I was quite content that <em>he</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>should be admiring <em>me</em>. It would have disappointed
me had he turned his attention likewise to the sun.
Suddenly he stooped down, and made a grab in my
direction. I had almost waited for this, and being
prepared, hopped quickly to one side. I felt it would
not enhance my charms to be caught too quickly.
He made no further attempt to catch me, but went
back into the house, and I heard my friend of the
duller coat laughing, as much as to say, ‘I told you
so.’ But I pretended to consider we had made great
advances. In a little while, however, he came out
again. He carried in his hand a curious string thing,
which is called a net, and this he laid with great
ingenuity across the path where he and I had
previously been walking. This I took as a great
compliment; the ground was evidently not good
enough for me to walk upon. Over this he spread
a few crumbs. They were not, certainly, to my
mind, as I liked more tasty things, but I thought he
had probably noticed my fragile appearance, and
was showing his sympathy with my delicacy. So
to show my trust in and appreciation of him, after
a little coquettish skipping on the edge, I hopped
straight to the centre of the net. He was kneeling
by the side, and I must admit my heart beat loudly
at my own boldness, but still remembering the kindness
of the maids, the only human beings that I
knew, I felt no particular or definite fear. In fact, I
felt like some great queen before a kneeling courtier.
But the next moment I was much upset to find the
net swung over me, and both of us caught roughly
and inelegantly from the ground, in a manner I had
never before experienced. I struggled, but only
succeeded in getting one leg through the net. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>position was indeed perilous. The last thing I heard
in the garden was the laughter of my friend who had
the duller coat. So can the frog heart be upon
occasion very hard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was thrown down afterwards upon a table that
had neither moss nor anything else upon it, still
enveloped in the hateful net, so that there was no
chance of me getting away, and there I stayed for a
long time, choking with fear and partial suffocation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A tremor ran through its little body.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shouldn’t like to speak of all that followed. As
frogs go, and being cold-blooded, I can stand a fair
amount. But that was neither here nor there. I
don’t know how long I lived there, but it was a long
time, and almost every day I was put to some torture
or other. Often others used to come in to see how
the different inflictions affected me, and once someone
remonstrated with him, and said I must suffer; but he
said he was always very careful with me, and the
other one seemed satisfied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Besides,’ he added, ‘it is in the cause of science.
And what little inconveniences may be suffered by this
reptile may be the means of saving many lives.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“That night as I was lying in my prison, with
every limb aching and swollen, and big pains shooting
through my body, I thought on his words. It was
only the extreme pain that kept me from growing
proud, so instead I felt a little thankful.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But after that the times of torture were growing
more frequent, or I less able to bear them, and I
longed and prayed to something I couldn’t understand
to set me free. And one day, as he took me
out of my cell, he said to someone who was with
him at the time—I think he called him his assistant:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>‘This thing is on its last legs; I’ll just try one more
experiment with it, and then it can be thrown to the
midden.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was a little comfort to me.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But just then he ran something through my hand
that made me struggle and gasp with pain, and then
the other three, and I was lying fast nailed to a board,
and could not even struggle. I’ll never forget it,
though the worst never comes back to me. It was
the last time, the last time with a vengeance, and there
I died. And I think I must have looked very queer
at the last, for the last thing I was conscious of was
that someone laughed. But how could one compose
one’s features nailed to a board, and suffering agony.
And when I woke up I was in this pretty garden, and
I was as feeble as a baby. But my master tended me
with his own hands, and before long I had grown
strong and happy again, and less wishful to been seen.
And though my coat is brighter now than ever it had
been, I think less of it and more of other things. But
even now it’s sweet to hear a little praise, and never
anyone has come to see my master but they have a
pleasant word for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then why do you stay with me? You should be
hopping in the garden, not in this dull place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I asked to come. I knew you’d have a deal
of sorrow once you came here; it’s meant to be a place
of sorrow; and I remembered that period of my own
life when I was all alone without companions. And I
think if someone could have come to me and said,
‘Cheer up, Croaker, it’ll soon all be over,’ I would
have felt a trifle stronger for the end.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was your name Croaker?” asked Rosalie gently,
for the story had much affected her.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“Yes; I used always to be longing to be called
‘Bright Coat’ or ‘Slim Body,’ or one of those names
when I was young, but my parents had different
thoughts from me, and gave me just a family name.
The scientists sometimes called me ‘Goggle Eyes,’
and I believe my eyes did grow unnaturally big
whilst I was there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s very kind of you to stay with me when I’m
so dull.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re not dull,” said the frog. “No one is,
unless they do nothing but nurse their sorrow, and
expect other people to carry both them and it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, one has a great deal to learn,” she answered,
and took down a book from the shelf.</p>

<p class='c004'>And hereafter most of her time was given to
learning, for the lesson-books had suddenly developed
into coherent reading. They were still hard and
dull, and many a time she would have given up but
for the ever-ringing voice that revived her lagging
spirits, and above all the remembrance of that jewel
of pure light, the like that she had seen within the
temple.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside the mist still continued heavy and white,
so that it was impossible to find the way about. It
hung like a heavy curtain. This continued for a
long time, until one day it gradually lightened, and
in a week’s time the sky was clear again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going to dig again,” said Rosalie to the frog,
laughing. “I feel I am intended to. The ground is
soft, and though my eagerness has gone, I still can
work when there is opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so in the same way she unbedded another
stone, and though it was smaller than the last, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>not of the same worth by any means, it had its
merits, and one pure flash in the centre to show it
was related to the larger one. Having given it into
the Governor’s hands, she returned to her own
dwelling, and waited some short time.</p>

<p class='c004'>But one day as she was going round the plantation,
holding a book and reading, with the frog hopping
by her side, she was startled to hear someone calling
over the gateway, “Good morning, Rosalie!” and
looking, she beheld Billy standing there, his arms
folded over it, and his face all laughing, as was usual
when he came.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning!” said she, and her eyes brightened
at such a change in the day’s programme.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve brought you bad news.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! then don’t repeat it. I know already what
it is,” and Rosalie sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know, I don’t think you’re ever going to get
out of this little paddock,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think so myself. Soon I shall be getting
past breaking in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you like digging?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’ve taken to it fairly well, thanks to my
little friend Croaker here. I regard myself as a
worm, and feel lowly contentment. Many a time I
have thought myself dead and the sun set.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must be very wretched to wish yourself
dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, the day is intensely long.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The worm will develop.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With a bruised head?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s imagination! A second miracle, and the
worm becomes a serpent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would much rather remain as I am. The worm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>is harmless—the serpent dangerous; the one a little
use—the other useless.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you from Lucifram!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! your mind was fixed on one particular
Serpent. Defend me from it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t look much older, Rosalie, for all your
work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you were tall before, and now you’re taller.
You actually seem older than I, and when first I saw
you I reckoned you quite ten years younger.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you’ve been burrowing in the ground. I’ve
been advancing. It makes all the difference. What
effect has my news had upon you?” he continued.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! for a change it has made me angry.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has the worm turned?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe it has been so long in a state of
constant wriggle that one turn more or less makes
little difference.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose you leave your unprofitable trade, and
come away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She took two steps forward with a thankful heart,
and then a great stubbornness rose within her. She
shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t go yet,” she said. “It would be giving
up too early. I have pleased God, and by God’s
grace I’ll please man, and if man is not to be
pleased by God’s grace, what is it that can please
him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is a question for my father. I should
not like to say. What do you intend to do here
now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dig again. Begin to-day. There is no frost,
and the ground is soft and loose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that the message I’m to return?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“I can think of no other. It was good of you to
bring the news to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought it very ill. I never delivered an
unpleasant message in my life before, and did it
just for practice. I had much rather have told you
the other thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your face was very expressive of sorrow when
you came to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m glad. I imagined my countenance was too
smiling.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never look sad on my account. I have no wish
to forfeit your company for a sad mask. Indeed, I
counted it a very great kindness your coming to me
at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Truly, Rosalie, you are improving. I think
you must be growing older.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve forgotten my age. It’s a thing women never
remember. Years were a form of imaginative
punishment invented by the devil. Some folks
are sensitive about them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you have finished this, will you bring it
to my father?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most certainly; who else could I take it to?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has brought you little luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a word I should never use in connection with
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I will leave you, and may you be
prosperous. I don’t know what else I can say,
except that you will forgive me for the news I
brought.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So saying, he turned about, and went away again.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the old work began once more.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <span class='large'>A SIMPLE CONVERSATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>One day, when Rosalie had about completed the
stone she was engaged upon, the Governor sent for
her, by the frog.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I think,” said Brightcoat, for Rosalie had
changed its name, not liking Croaker, “that it would
not be at all a bad plan for us to look and see if there
are any new clothes anywhere about. This old dress
you are wearing is most worn and shabby.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are none,” said she. “I have looked many
a time, and have never found anything except the
coarse brown apron I wear to protect my dress from
the soil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, there’s a time, and not a time, for looking
for things. Suppose we look in the little wardrobe
together now. If you stay dinner with the Governor,
you must be fairly suitably dressed for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And what was Rosalie’s surprise, on looking in the
diminutive dress-closet, to find a pretty dress of softest
silk, white and apple green, just ready made to fit
her figure, and everything besides to match, even to
silken stockings and pretty slippers, and a cluster of
red and golden leaves upon the dressing-table, as
simple and pretty as the rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie, from feeling old as the hills, suddenly felt
young as a blue-bell blowing on an early summer
morning.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Oh, Brightcoat! I never felt so happy in my
life. To get rid of this old black and red thing!
Why, that in itself is Paradise. But to wear these!
It’s past belief. Now, if you were me, how would
you wear your hair—high or low? Which do you
think suits me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say in that loose bundle at the back you used
to wear when you first came to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The way Mariana did it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Oh, dear, dear! I’m afraid I shan’t do it a
bit nicely. When you try to do your hair nicely it
always looks hideous; have you ever noticed that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; you see I haven’t got any.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not! My dress is almost the exact
colours of your skin. Have you noticed it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. My master said the colours were chosen
out of compliment to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How delightful! Frog green! It’s quite an
innovation in fashions, and a very pretty one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Brightcoat’s eyes sparkled with pleasure at this
little bit of innocent flattery, and if it showed vanity,
vanity of a sort is a very delightful thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Rosalie dressed with fluttering happiness and
eager haste.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your hair doesn’t look a bit as if you’d taken
pains with it,” said the frog from the bed, where it
was sitting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?” she asked, with sudden
alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s very becoming.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d rather your flattery was a little less open. I
know you mean well, but it’s embarrassing to have
one’s defects spoken of so charmingly.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>By this time the dressing was completed, and in
the eyes of her simple companion no one had ever
looked more lovely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must come too, Brightcoat. I shouldn’t
think of leaving you here alone. Besides, you are
always welcome at the house, and I am only there
on suffrage. If I behave badly I must go. It’s a
very terrible thing that, when you think about it.
Enough to make me tremble and shake all over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So the frog jumped lightly from the bed on to her
shoulder, and made a most delightful ornament.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they walked across the garden to the house the
nightingales were singing in the soft still air of night.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Governor, who was walking on the terrace,
greeted his guests, and they passed into the house,
which was all brilliantly lit to receive them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is your last night with us, so I have asked
you here to dine with me,” said the old man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My last night?” Her voice was full of wonder
and sadness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You surely will not be sorry to leave the soil?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! but you and Brightcoat are here. I would
much rather stay. Besides, my heart is in the garden
yet, and here with the jewels that I brought to you.
Oh, you have been my friend; and there is none
other. Where else can I go? Let me still live in
the little hut, with the freedom I have bought
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But he shook his head and smiled as they sat down
to dinner just alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You imagine you have become attached to the
hut. But there are other and better places, believe
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And does the way back lead as I came?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Pretty much so, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Into Marble House, with its shadows and cobwebs.
I’m sure I daren’t go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps it has become less shadowy since you
were there. There is spring cleaning, you know, in
all well-regulated houses.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it is not well regulated. There is one part
all moths and mildew, and people live in it, or rather
work there. I know, for Mariana does. How I should
love to see her once again! And upstairs it is
wretchedly lit. In fact, Mr. Barringcourt’s private
room was the only human-looking place I ever saw
there. But perhaps by now he has a wife. But she’ll
need great strength of mind to get the necessary
repairs done, I’m thinking. He seemed as if he
would be very conservative, except where things
affected his own comfort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think he’s got a wife yet,” said the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they had finished the meal, and the frog had
had its full share of the dainties that were to its taste,
the Governor led the way to his own room, and
placing a chair for Rosalie near the fire, he drew his
own to the other side of the fireplace and sat down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you object to smoke?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! Uncle had a pipe that he had smoked
for years and years and years. And the night before
he died he let it fall, and it broke. I remember how
sad he looked at the time—and perhaps there was
more in it than just the breaking of the pipe, for he
said nothing, but that he could soon get a new one.
And if all things had been right I think it would
have angered him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were greatly attached to your uncle?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Oh, yes! I loved them both. No one could have
been kinder to me than they.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now, when you go back to Lucifram, you
have neither friend nor relation to go to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Must I indeed go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see no other way for it. But there are some
friends of mine live there, or friends of someone
that I know. They will fill, to the best of their
ability, the old place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you know? They might take the
utterest distaste to me on first sight, and then what
would happen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are not people of prejudice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish I were not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You fear, then, you may take a dislike to
them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! I’m always trying to get the better of
my feelings, because they are so often wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said he, “second thoughts are best. I
give you the benefit of a second opinion upon most
things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But there is where I fear to go back to Lucifram.
It’s a place where one is so terribly misjudged, and
it’s a place, too, where you have just the knack of
saying the things you wished unsaid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, choose. Will you go back, or will
you stay?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie, on second thoughts, made answer:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know best, and it is for you to choose.
Somehow, I could not think to doubt or question
what you say; and after all, why should one bother
about to-morrow, if one does one’s duty to-day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I have promised you friends in the place of
your aunt and uncle.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“Yes; but I thought Mr. Barringcourt might have
a word to say about that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we’re all bound to trust the future to a
certain extent. There is no telling; on second
acquaintance he might prove kinder.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When must I go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow, in the early morning. The journey
takes a day; it will be dark before you reach your
journey’s end, for autumn is far advanced with
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the frog, who had so far sat quiet on the
hearthrug, put in a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be very lonely going back to Lucifram
alone. My advice and companionship might be of
some little help occasionally.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes!” cried Rosalie eagerly. “You have been
such a faithful and loving friend to me, that your
brightness would dispel half the gloom, I’m sure it
would.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Both of them turned their eyes toward the
Governor to gain his opinion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bear a charmed life, little frog,” said he, “so
I don’t see what harm or inconvenience can happen
to you. In fact, I think the outing would be a
pleasant trip for you, and add something to your
store of knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t think,” said Rosalie anxiously, for
second thoughts were beginning to intrude themselves,
“that any harm could come of it. I remember
Mr. Barringcourt saying something about vivisection
once. It would be terrible if anything happened,
and I was powerless to prevent it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think anything could happen,” replied
the Governor. “A frog that has once jumped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>from Lucifram successfully to heaven could, on
a pinch, repeat the process with much less
inconvenience.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And soon after this the interview and evening
ended.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <span class='large'>A MAN WHO STOOD ON HIS HEAD, ACCORDING TO LUCIFRAM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The two wanderers were standing once more in the
cold, inhospitable streets of Lucifram. But they were
not alone. A tall lady descending from her carriage
had noticed the forlorn Rosalie, and pitying her tired
condition had taken her within her house, promising
her one night’s shelter at least. It may be simply
stated to whom Rosalie in this hour of need had come.
In this particular house in Lime Tree Square of the
chief city of Lucifram there lived a very great painter
and his sister. In his early youth he had had a hard
struggle, not so much because he was poor, but
because he was original. Now, for a man to have his
own ideas in the city of Lucifram was to set all the
dogs barking, the mob stone-flinging, and the Riot
Act fluttering.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was very strange, but thousands of years of
experience had taught little or nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The painter, as has been said, had his own ideas,
and so at first they said he was an upstart, and very
justly laughed at him. But laughter never yet cured
madness or stamped out the truth, and as the painter
seemed to be giving surreptitious invisible spiritual
bites all round him, and setting the infection flying, it
was recognised at last there must be some truth in his
madness, and to a certain extent they let him be.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>And so from being badly abused the painter at last
sprung into fame. He was a shy and reserved man,
and somewhat irritable in his temper. But that was
because his temperament and his work were of a
kind that wear the nerves unevenly. But still when
he liked he could be very charming, even Lucifram
admitted that, and for the hidden virtues, they left
those with a shrug to God the Serpent.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so in comparative early middle age he found
himself the recipient of a knighthood; that is, he
received a title very similar to “Sir”—and for
simplicity we will call it such. Some spiteful people
said this was on account of his good looks, but as
it was a man sovereign who gave him the title, it’s
hard to see what that could have to do with it. Now,
Sir John himself had little belief in titles, but his sister
had great belief in <em>him</em>, and though herself the simplest
of plain women, she had ambitions so far as he was
concerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A title’s an empty thing,” said he, looking at her
in his serious, thoughtful way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one knows it better than I,” she answered,
in her downright one. “And if you hadn’t the real
thing to outshine it, I’d hate to see it offered to you.
But it’s a courtesy you owe to the world in return
for its courtesy. If you don’t accept it, you are
churlish. Besides, I always think it’s the greatest
honour that can befal a sovereign, to confer
distinction upon genius, so that, even on a royal
consideration, I think you ought to accept.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so plain John Crokerly became Sir John, and
was just the same before and after—neither more or
less brilliant or imposing.</p>

<p class='c004'>From being poor he became rich. He never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>married, but continued happily in the society of
his one unmarried sister. The affection and understanding
were very mutual, and perfectly to the
contentment of both.</p>

<p class='c004'>On this particular night Miss Crokerly entered her
brother’s presence with some trepidation. After all,
she had a reputation for common sense, though, like
him, maybe a little eccentric, and the brightness of
the frog and the prettiness of Rosalie’s face hardly
seemed pretext enough on second thoughts for
inviting her into the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“John,” said she, betraying no misgiving in her
voice, as she closed the door, “I’ve invited a young
girl from the country, who is lost, to come in and
shelter for the night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s her name?” and he looked up over the
top of the paper which he was reading, for daylight
was precious just then, and morning meals too hasty
to allow of much newspaper indulgence during them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know; she is a perfect stranger to me.
I came to see if you approved.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It won’t matter to me. I shan’t see her,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not.” Then, after a pause: “You think
I’m not running any risks by bringing her in?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. You can’t very well turn her out
again now you’ve done it. Small-pox is pretty
prevalent, to be sure. Did you make particular
inquiries if she’d been successfully vaccinated?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have no objection to what I’ve done?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not after you’ve done it,” and he relapsed once
more behind the paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Miss Crokerly, after turning to the door,
looked round again.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“I should like you to see her,” she said, for her,
very hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the morning,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the morning you will have less time and
inclination than now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what purpose should I serve in going to look
at her? Is she different from the generality of
country folk?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” she replied slowly; “but I think
she is much prettier. And she has with her a frog
with the most brilliant colour I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this he laughed. “My curiosity is not excited
in the least,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But mine <em>is</em>,” she said, with a return to her
decided manner; “and you really must come, if but
to see the frog. It is a marvel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bring it here to me, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly not, unless I bring her too. You are
growing terribly lazy, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, come along,” he said impatiently. “Only
please don’t drag me into any more of your charitable
whims, frogs or no frogs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not. This is an exception. You might
ask her her name and address. I quite forgot to do
so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So together they went into the hall where Rosalie
still sat. The frog, with a wisdom born of its dead
vanity, had again settled itself conspicuously to
attract attention on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s pale face and large bright eyes also
possessed a peculiar beauty and fascination, although
she was tired with the journey and sick from want of
food.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, Sir John’s heart was as kind as that of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>sister, and, moreover, he had a great admiration for
woman when her beauty was of that delicate yet
exquisite type that approaches the ideal, and contains
little of the heaviness or substantiality of flesh. As
they both came toward her, Rosalie rose, and her
movements were so quiet, graceful, and well-bred,
that one might have thought the frog’s spirit of
wishing to do the correct thing for the sake of
admiration had settled upon her. All his irritability,
which was not of a very lasting or savage kind,
vanished.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have a delightful little companion there,”
said he pleasantly, looking at the frog.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is rather an uncommon kind of pet,” put in
Miss Crokerly; “and how brilliant! Is it real, or
some highly-polished stone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! it is real enough, and can jump prodigiously.”
And she put her hand up caressingly to its coat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you,” said Sir John—“you look tired. What
part of the country have you come from to get lost
in the city?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have been walking all day. I came from a
little hut and plantation beyond the forest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this the painter looked at his sister and she at
him. For outside this city of Lucifram there was a
tremendous forest full of jungles, and only the pure
in spirit and those led by a light of superhuman
brightness could pass through it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did you pass through the forest unhurt?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. We were pleasant company to each other.
But I lost one of my garden clogs. I think that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>very unfortunate, because I never missed it till it was
too late to turn back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She spoke evidently without any knowledge of the
terrors of the forest. But whatever reticence she
showed about her journey was from now respected
by them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you have no home to return to?” said Miss
Crokerly, after a pause, during which she had
revolved things in her mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Rosalie simply, and her wistful eyes
filled with anxiety and shadow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must spend the night here, then, as I said
before, and in the morning we will arrange things.
Come with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Sir John shook hands with her in that grave,
kind way of his, and wished her good-night, and then
went back to his easy-chair and paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>He himself knew something of the terrors and
blackness of the forest. It had been responsible for
some of his best work. But he was a man whose
hair was turning grey, and this girl, whose name, by
the way, he had forgotten to ask, appeared so very
young. He was interested in, and felt sorry for her,
and yet could scarcely credit the tale that she had
come hither from the forest; on second thoughts it
seemed so utterly improbable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet where else anywhere upon Lucifram could that
brilliant frog have come from—or Rosalie’s expressive,
shining eyes?</p>

<p class='c004'>So when his sister came back later in the evening,
he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think, for the present, at any rate, we must keep
her. Providence has sent her to us, and converts a
duty into pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Yes, indeed. She has had supper and gone to
bed. And strange to say,” she continued reflectively,
“although for the last twenty-five years I have been
trying to cure myself of impulsiveness as one of my
besetting sins, and was just thinking as I drove home
to-night that at last I had quite succeeded, yet now I
cannot help loving her at sight, as much,” she added
softly, “as if she were my own sister.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is fortunate for her,” replied he. “She
appears so destitute.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I don’t doubt fortunate for me. It is not
often one receives a traveller from the forest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have ascertained, then, that she really came
from there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course! I ascertained it by attending simply
to her voice and manner. One needs no other
guarantees.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I can but hope your friendship stands the
test of time. For myself, I can only say, as usual, I
think you showed true discernment in admitting her
to shelter for the night, though at first, to speak
truthfully, I must admit your conduct greatly
astonished me. What is her name?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie Paleaf.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <span class='large'>A NEW LEASE OF LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Rosalie awoke next morning, it was in a
comfortable modern bedroom, furnished with regard
to health, and a conception of beauty thrown in.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the first time truly in her life and experience
she awoke with a light heart, and such unusual
brightness of spirits that she seemed at last, for the
time at least, to have realised the pleasure and joy of
simply being alive. The tired sickness of the night
before had entirely vanished.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sky overhead was blue and bright, the air cold.
Nothing could have been more promising for a new
entry into an old world.</p>

<p class='c004'>Brightcoat, who had spent the night on the marble
washing-stand, now took recreation in the basin of
water Rosalie poured for him, whilst she, being less
cold-blooded, as it were, was nothing loath to accept
the warm water that was brought for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>But this part of the day’s programme being
finished, Rosalie turned disconsolately to her dress.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s so shabby and short,” said she.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, look amongst your luggage,” said Brightcoat,
who was engaged in jumping for further recreation
over all the articles on the washstand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My luggage,” said she, looking towards the little
hand-bag. “It can’t be in there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No harm in looking,” said the frog, and jumped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>clean over the water-jug, and then sat as still as if
jumping were the last thing it would ever think of
doing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed, and then opened the bag and
looked.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was packed into that little leather hand-bag
everything to make a perfect though not extravagant
outfit. A coat and skirt that no fashionable tailor
would be ashamed to turn out, a pretty, simple dress
for household wear, the evening dress which she had
worn the other night, slippers, gloves, and all
accessories. Last but not least, there was a little
box of jewellery in perfect taste and finish.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Brightcoat, look, look!” she cried, as one
after the other she drew out those new delights.
“Who can have done it? I don’t think it could have
been the Governor. I’m sure he never bothered
much about one’s clothes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then the frog’s voice fell to a reverent whisper,
so it almost seemed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I once saw the Governor’s wife pack a Christmas
box for a little boy a long way off at school, and it
was quite miraculous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was he her son?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! At least, not exactly her son. But she
was very fond of him. She forgot nothing, and sent
it in such little room that no one thought she was
sending anything much at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have seen her, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I’ve seen her; and never anything more
absolutely beautiful. It was she who put her tender,
gentle hand upon me when first I came all dead and
dull and stunned from Lucifram, and by her radiating
brightness changed my poor coat to brilliancy. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>have you turned out all the contents of your
bag?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. No. Here are two letters. One for me
and one to Sir—John—Crokerly. Who’s he, I
wonder?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The man who lives here,” said the frog, who was
primitive, and believed in calling men men, and
women women, with no thought of discourtesy, but
from lack of education in those matters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The gentleman,” said Rosalie. “He’s sure to be
a gentleman if he has a title. But how do you know
his name?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I heard someone speak of the—the lady
last night as Miss Crokerly, and they said something
about Sir John. And putting two and two together,
I’ve come to the conclusion it is he who lives here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How strange!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stranger things have happened. Have you read
your letter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” and she broke open the envelope. At first
she read it seriously, then burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” asked Brightcoat eagerly, who,
having long ago got over the seriousness of vanity,
could enjoy a joke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, this letter! It’s been written in a kind of
rhyme, and I’m sure I don’t know what it means.
It seems utter nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it’s not very private, and you read it aloud,
I might be able to help you,” the frog replied
courteously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, listen. There is no address. It begins:</p>

      <div class='line'>Yet climb the invisible mountain.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There now, Brightcoat, what do you think of
that? Can you fathom it? I think it’s a very
charming puzzle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who do you think wrote it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, the Governor! And out of compliment to
his wife I feel bound somehow or other to—to
endeavour to accomplish the task set me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Horses so white they dazzle the sun, and six of
them,” said Brightcoat thoughtfully. “Do you think
you’ll ever manage it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. But there’s no harm in trying.”
And she laughed again, and was most becomingly
dressed in no time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then together, the frog taking its accustomed place
upon her shoulder, they descended the staircase.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the hall Miss Crokerly and her brother stood
talking, he in a thick overcoat ready for going
out.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Rosalie approached and handed her letter to him,
which he received kindly, though with some surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I found it in my bag,” said she, “and had no idea
it was there. I think you are Sir John?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After he had read the letter enclosed, he handed it
to his sister. She read it with evident interest, then
returned it to him, and holding out her hand to the
new-comer, said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re very pleased to receive you, Rosalie. And
as long as you care to stay with us you will be
welcome, apart from any considerations except those
of friendship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid I’m too poor to accept your hospitality
for a longer time than it takes me to find work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor? The letter to my brother is from the
wealthiest banker of our acquaintance, the safest and
surest. And his statement proves you anything but
poor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie remembered the jewels she had
found, and remained silent. She had prized them
very much and loved them, and now she understood
their value, in one of those flashes of perception that
occasionally comes to all of us.</p>

<p class='c004'>After that Sir John went away, and Miss Crokerly
led the way into the dining-room, where breakfast
was laid for Rosalie only, as the others had long since
had theirs.</p>

<p class='c004'>And that day passed away as healthily and
normally as Rosalie could wish, and a morning’s
shopping was quite a pleasant recreation to her, and
in fact the first of its kind she had ever indulged in
in her life.</p>

<p class='c004'>For to be dumb is a great drawback, as most of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>can understand, and curtails most pleasures, little or
big.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then for tea some very interesting people
dropped in, or so Rosalie found them, and altogether
the weary, dead, dull, lonely level of life seemed to
have vanished.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE SCANDAL OF THE TEMPLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Now it chanced one night that Miss Crokerly wrote
a letter after the bag had gone to post, and Rosalie,
seeing that it was dry and frosty, had offered to take
it to the pillar-box, which was a few minutes’ walk
away at the end of the next square. It was so
pleasant out of doors that she took the longest way,
and having slipped the letter in the box, prepared
to take the same road back.</p>

<p class='c004'>On turning a corner, her attention was attracted by
someone coming towards her, scarcely fifty yards
away, reading a letter, so it seemed to her, with
apparently no more trouble than if it had been
daylight. But that fact, though it afterwards
occurred to her, was forgotten in the shock of
recognising that here was Mr. Barringcourt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie stood still under the gas-lamp, unable to
move, paralysed with fear. An instinct of safety
should have made her move along, but here she
stood, courting observation by standing directly
in the path, with big wide eyes fixed upon his face.
Just then he looked up with bent brows and eyes.
They came directly in contact with Rosalie’s white
and terrified face. In an instant his abstracted air
vanished, and a very present alertness took the
place of his thoughts. Like a flash of lightning
Rosalie turned and sped the near way home,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>reaching the safety of the doorstep in less than
three minutes. She did not stop to breathe till
safe within the friendly shelter of the hall, where
something told her to regain a little composure,
at any rate, before appearing before Miss Crokerly.
She went upstairs and removed her hat and the rich
evening wrap she had drawn round her, sat down
for a little while to recover her breath, and then
descended to the drawing-room again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly, intent upon some fine needlework,
did not look up on her entrance; but Rosalie had one
friend whose eyes were sharper and perceptions
more acute. The frog, whom she had left sitting
upon the timepiece, looked across at her. Rosalie
gained assurance from that glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>She sat down without any remark, and took up
the book she had been reading, making some
pretence of continuing her occupation as before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve heard a rumour,” said Miss Crokerly
presently, “that the Great High Priest is resigning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is he?” asked Rosalie absently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Great High Priest of the Serpent,” continued
Miss Crokerly. “I can scarcely credit it, though. He
is barely seventy-two. And he can have no reason
for it either. It’s an office never vacated till death.
Dotage doesn’t count.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe he is more conscientious than most,” said
Rosalie, rousing herself from her own line of thought
to take an interest in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. There have been
whispers of it for the last three years. I think
he has enemies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose all men in prominent positions have.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but there are enemies and enemies. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>my opinion of the Great High Priest is that he has
hidden enemies, or perhaps he chances to be merely
unfortunate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?” asked Rosalie, beginning
to be interested in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it began with a scandal. A rumour got
about that he had admitted a woman to see the
Serpent, and some said such conduct was nothing
short of blasphemous. But that was either hushed
up or contradicted. Contradicted, I think, and then
hushed up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would it be such a terrible thing for a woman to
see the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, there’s a great deal of superstition and
ignorance mixed up with our religion, as all simple
and right-minded people can see. But it grows in
suitable soil, so it’s strong and holds well together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did it not please the people that a woman
had seen the Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Naturally not, after thousands of years of
prejudice. Some of the best—by that I mean the
<em>narrowest</em>—women I know withdrew their support
(they were extremely wealthy) from the temple for
some months during the scandal. They said they
felt the brightness of the Serpent had been sullied.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Absurd!” said Rosalie; and the blood began
to course a little quicker through her veins from
indignation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Miss Crokerly slowly, “one can’t
judge quickly. Of course you know the Great High
Priest is not allowed to have a wife. She is separated
from him the day he takes up office, and if he did
admit a woman from idle curiosity to see the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Serpent—well, judged from one point, it was very
serious.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe,” said Rosalie, whose tongue was itching
to say much more. “But do you think there was
any truth in it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, yes. A woman’s handkerchief with a red
rose embroidered in the corner was found upon the
altar.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never!” said Rosalie, with such a visible jump
and accents so sharp that Miss Crokerly looked up,
and the frog’s eyes grew wide with warning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was so, indeed. My brother had it on good
authority. One of the Golden Priests went in that
evening to offer the prayer at the New Moon. He
found it there. And then this hushed-up scandal
followed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Rosalie was silent, why, she could scarcely
tell. She recognised the handkerchief, which in after
events she had never missed. It was her aunt’s
birthday gift, with a little silk-embroidered rose in
the corner instead of a name.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why did the Golden Priest remark upon it?”
asked Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is what I say. And it is that which makes
me think the Great High Priest has enemies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But such a thing as that, once died down, could
not make him resign.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps not. But I don’t think it ever really
did die down. And last year at the ‘Feast of White
Souls,’ after the Fast of Black Ones, as he was
coming out from between the curtains to sprinkle
white confetti down the temple aisles, a most
unfortunate thing occurred. The crimson curtain
suddenly tore from the rings and fell, and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>behind, to the view of a mixed assembly, shone out
the Golden Serpent. I was there myself, having
gone to hear the music, for on these occasions it is
very fine, and was sitting with my brother quite near
to the choir stalls.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what did you do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it was very strange, but we all instinctively
did the same thing. I took one real good look at
the Serpent (and I don’t know any woman there who
didn’t, except those who screamed, and some who
fainted, for what, it would be hard to tell), and then,
from a sense of what was due to the male part of the
congregation, we covered our eyes with our handkerchiefs,
and all turning our backs upon the God we
worshipped, were led solemnly out, with comparatively
little confusion. The service could not continue, and
that event has made him the most unpopular man on
Lucifram.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” said Rosalie, half laughing, half sarcastically,
leaning back in her chair, and looking at the
fire, “I should say it would not be a bad idea to
introduce a ‘Feast of Handkerchiefs’ to take the
place of the unfortunate White Souls. A handkerchief
betrayed one woman and saved the rest. It
should receive a place of honour in the temple.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a pity he did not take it in that way,” said
Miss Crokerly. “But I’ve heard since that the
occurrence has depressed him terribly. And the
last news is that he is resigning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And which of the Golden Priests was it who
spread the first report?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“His name is Alphonso. I know him slightly, but
do not care for him. I think him ambitious, and
unscrupulous, and narrow-minded. I cannot help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>but think myself he is the greatest enemy the High
Priest has, though there are some who uphold him
as the strictest and highest principled man within
the Church.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I dislike him already,” said Rosalie impulsively.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you will have an opportunity of meeting him
to-morrow night at the Sebberens’. He is unmarried,
so you may be as charming as you like to him, and
no one’s heart will break. But for all that he’s greatly
run after by the women. They regard the Golden
Priests and the Great High Priest as demi-gods.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Golden Priests were those whose rank came
next to that of the Great High Priest, and when
this latter died his place was always filled from this
exclusive body of great men, the wealthiest and most
powerful in the Church of Lucifram.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! that will make me dislike him all the more,”
said Rosalie. “The men who are run after by
women, and the women who are run after by men,
are both equally detestable. I mean, of course, in
excess.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that is fascination.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I prefer the fascination that is clever enough to
captivate its own sex.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, men admire him in an intellectual capacity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A general favourite? Most insipid!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Really, Rosalie!” said Miss Crokerly, and she
laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You cannot expect me to love him. A man
should always be loyal to his superior.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, of course, I am only giving you my own
opinion. And you must not repeat it on any
account; because it is not generally believed or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>certain that he might be prompted by motives of
ambition to make known the incident of the
handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope that if the High Priest does resign
someone less self-seeking takes his place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Than Golden Priest Alphonso? But that is
scarcely likely. He has Mr. Barringcourt for his great
friend, and—What is the matter, Rosalie? Your
cheeks are all aflame.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I—I—I’ve had springes of toothache all
day, and the sudden pain makes me flush. I’m all
right now. What were you saying?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Alphonso is sure to succeed to the High
Priestship sooner or later. He has much influence
on his side—the Prime Minister, and Lord High
All Superior for public and official friends, and Mr.
Barringcourt, whom I just mentioned, who has great
influence in outside circles, and more money
apparently than even poor Geoffrey Todbrook had.
Now there’s a man for you to dislike cordially
on the grounds of general favouritism. The women
idolise him, and men will hear no wrong of
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what kind of a life does he lead? Is he
a good man?” asked Rosalie, leaning forward and
looking across at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. My brother thinks greatly of him,
and so do I. But it’s hard to tell who’s good and
who’s bad when you come to private life. There are
so many things for and against it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still, I think as rich men go, who are young and
unfettered by anything, he must be fairly good. I
don’t remember ever hearing anything against him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>And I know he has carried out all Geoffrey Todbrook’s
wishes with regard to charities to the letter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he executor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then it would be surprising if he fell short of his
duties, would it not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps so. I expect he too will be at the
Sebberens’ to-morrow night But if you have any
conversation with Mr. Barringcourt at all, you
cannot choose but like him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is his temper unfailingly pleasant, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; it isn’t altogether that. I have known him
very absent and off-hand. But I suppose people
occasionally find that rather pleasant in a world of
suavity and insincerity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t agree with you. I’d rather have people
unfailingly suave. It spares a great deal of friction.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has upset you, Rosalie? You are most
argumentative to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I expect you are spoiling me, and I’ve never
been accustomed to it. You should treat me with
stern severity, and you would find me improve
wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you just preaching unfailing suavity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I preach by the Creed of Contrary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie’s argumentative mood sprang really
from the irritation that followed on the evening’s
escapade.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a cooler moment, and on reflection, she was not
over and above proud of the way in which she had
fled so precipitately before the enemy. And yet what
was there to be done? To have stood still was to
have hazarded, so Rosalie thought, far more than she
had any intention of hazarding. She registered a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>mental vow never to go out at night alone again, and
wished, oh! wished most intensely, that nothing had
tempted her out that night. In her own room the
frog broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You seem very upset to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I—I met Mr. Barringcourt, and I ran
away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What made you run?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was frightened of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What harm could he work you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! he might have persuaded me in a moment
of weakness I owed him a debt of gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And yet you have the kiss of freedom on your
brow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but like most abstract things, it sank before
the concrete.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll get over it by the morning. Sleep upon it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should have had you with me. You have far
less fear than I. The farther off the episodes of
Marble House become the more I dread them. They
seemed all right, and yet they were all wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Crokerly said you would probably meet Mr.
Barringcourt to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I know. And it was only this morning I
congratulated myself he was not in her set, and that
I should never be likely to meet him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you meet Mr. Barringcourt to-morrow night,
you won’t run away—will you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; because it will be light, and there will be
people about, and I shall have you. No, I won’t
run away in any case. But you will come with me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course! I should have very much enjoyed the
fresh air to-night; but you did not invite me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sorry. But I’ve paid the penalty of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>negligence; from henceforth you must never leave
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What dress do you intend to wear to-morrow
night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The one I have worn all along.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s as shabby as if you’d been digging in it. But
the morning may bring you another.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope it may not be very heavy, in case I should
have to depend on my heels again.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <span class='large'>AT THE SEBBERENS’</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The Sebberens were people who indulged greatly
in private theatricals and other sorts of entertainment.
With the amateur they included the professional,
and in between the acts, songs and recitations were
contributed by the latter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Sebberen had been engaged in pork, and had
made enough money thereby to make the pig
respected—as an investment, anyway. He married
a waitress in a restaurant, who was neither more
nor less charming and handsome than most of her
class. She had ambitions, and was young.</p>

<p class='c004'>But for ten long years they had no children,
and never a scrap of the pig was wasted. And
those ten years were years of increase. Then to
put spirit to an ambition somewhat sordid, a little
daughter was born. Both parents were beside
themselves with joy. It is not everyone who can
manage so much, after breeding nothing but gold
or pork, and so they felt. It’s a common thing to
be a mother after a lapse of one year, but after ten!
they grew proud on the strength of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>And another ten years had trebled the ample
fortune, nay, more than trebled it, and Mr. Sebberen,
a comparatively young man—scarce forty—found
himself with a daughter only ten years old.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another decade saw her twenty, he in the prime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of life, her mother too. “Sebberen’s Pork” was of
world-wide fame. The king and the chief prince had
it on their breakfast tables; the poor still bought
the sausages, and doctors still evinced a weakness
for onions, milk, and tripe.</p>

<p class='c004'>No one would have known, to walk into this
grand house, that its occupants once lived behind
a little pork shop. For Susiebelle was handsome
and clever, and had taught her mother a thing or
two, and made great friends at school, not
from any particular virtue, but from the glamour
of outside show. She had a great deal of
the outward semblance of that inward spirit that
had made her father what he was. She was
shallow and brilliant, and a perfect mimic of the
world.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the world wept, she wept. They called
her tender-hearted.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it laughed, she also laughed. They called
her gay.</p>

<p class='c004'>When in a mood for admiration, she, too, had
time for adulation, admired arts and music, knotted
her pretty brows at science, and bought rich copies
of all the works of fashionable poets. And what
was all this for?</p>

<p class='c004'>Susiebelle at twenty made up her mind to marry,
and marry as well as could be. Her father had just
had a tremendous stroke of luck in business. She
set her mind upon a duke, shooting high to reach
as far as fortune favoured.</p>

<p class='c004'>One year had passed away, and Susiebelle’s
ambition has not yet been granted. A poor baronet,
an insipid, weak-eyed lord; not bad for a beginning,
certainly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>And this brings us to to-night, the amateur
theatricals, and gay company.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir John was under commission to paint the
lovely Susiebelle, and had undertaken it with a
fine courtesy that made her mother glow with
pride to think the great were servants of the—the
small. And Sir John would do it successfully after
all, for she was pretty enough to appeal to the sense
of beauty in any artist, and her parents were over
and above willing to pay.</p>

<p class='c004'>And that is why Sir John went to the party—from
motives of conscientiousness. And Miss
Crokerly went because she wished to give
pleasure to Rosalie. She, an ideal chaperon
and friend. And Rosalie went because there was
no way out of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie’s dress was in itself that night a thing
of beauty. Green, as bright and dazzling a green as
the frog’s coat, that fitted to her graceful figure as
perfectly as the shining scales of a serpent’s coils,
worked with tiny seed jewels and edgings of gold.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You look just like the mermaid,” said the frog,
“your hair is so pale, and your eyes so bright, and
your skin so fair, and your lips are as red as coral.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie looked in the glass just as once
before when comparing herself with Mariana, and
laughed again just as then, and clasped her hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, when she was ready, she went to Miss
Crokerly’s room, who, on seeing her, uttered an
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is the matter?” asked Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe your frog is a beautifier. Take care
no one steals it in the crush to-night. Or perhaps I
ought to take the credit to myself. I think I shall.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>You have improved in appearance since coming
here, Rosalie, and to-night you look quite radiant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you,” and with a sudden touch of
impulsiveness Rosalie kissed her. “You are so
kind to me that the credit is yours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they reached the Sebberens’ the large
party was assembling in the great drawing-room,
which had been changed into a theatre for the
occasion. Supper was to follow, but light refreshments
were being handed round, and proved very
useful to take the chill off the commencement, as
it were. And music not too obtrusive helped
digestion. Rosalie’s heart beat quicker as they
entered the brilliantly-lit room, advance and retreat
covered by Miss Crokerly and her brother, before
and behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just inside the wide doors stood Mrs. Sebberen
talking to a grey-haired man; Susiebelle was busy
behind the curtain, so could not be in attendance
upon the guests.</p>

<p class='c004'>She greeted Miss Crokerly effusively, stared, as is
perfectly compatible with good manners, at Rosalie
from head to foot, became effusive to her, and then
bestowed the same greeting upon Sir John. There
was no doubt about it, she was a happy and genial
woman. She evidently considered them among her
guests of honour or chief friendship, for in person she
conducted them to a line of seats near to the front.
She was dressed in rich black satin, and looked
handsome enough to be imposing.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the way she talked much to Miss Crokerly,
but looked much at Rosalie, her dress, her face, the
curious little animal upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beyond a certain interest, Rosalie read nothing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>her glance. Then when they were seated, she passed
away again, and Rosalie found time to look around.
Everything and everybody were very brilliant. And
she recognised some of her new acquaintances, but
none more intimate. At last she whispered to Miss
Crokerly—Sir John had left them for the moment:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is the Golden Priest Alphonso?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly’s sharp eyes travelled round the
assembly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is not here yet,” said she. “Of course I
don’t know, but I expect that he will come. There
is Lady Flamington and her husband. Is she not
beautiful? but very sad-looking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lady Flamington—Lady Flamington! Oh!
where is she?” said Rosalie, in an eager voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>But just then the lady spoken of, who was sitting
some distance to the right a row in front, turned
round, and seeing Miss Crokerly, rose and came
toward her. Her smile was very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am deserting my husband for better company,”
said she. “I dragged him here against his will, low
be it spoken, and am paying the penalty in sulks.
Your brother is easier to manage, Miss Crokerly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The privilege of management is not mine. I am
only his sister.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are too modest. There was never a man
yet who governed himself; he couldn’t manage it.
It ends in sudden death or corpulency. Both are
dreadful things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will perhaps have heard what heavy
responsibilities I have taken upon myself lately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I hear you have turned chaperon,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Lady Flamington looked across at Rosalie and
smiled as pleasantly as before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly introduced them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you fond of private theatricals?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve never been to any,” replied Rosalie candidly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She was an only child, and brought up very
strictly,” said Miss Crokerly, at which Lady
Flamington said “Oh!” and looked toward the
door.</p>

<p class='c004'>She remained sitting by them till the play began,
talking with both of them. At last she said to
Rosalie:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know, I have the oddest sensation that I
have met you before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think so,” said Rosalie. “I have a very
good memory for faces, and I have never seen you
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps I am mistaken. People often resemble
each other so curiously.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But now silence was imposed. The play had
begun in earnest, and it was quite interesting enough
to retain the attention. When the act was over, a
song by a very well-known singer was announced;
but before this came off a few late arrivals made their
entrance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is the Golden Priest,” said Miss Crokerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He came in with two more gentleman. He was
tall and thin, with a narrow face and black hair.
His eyes were deeply set and fixed close together.
His nose was long, and his lips very thin and straight.
He looked clever; beyond that he was scarcely
prepossessing, but he was evidently made much of in
that assembly. They gave him a seat upon the very
first row. And yet he never ceased to preach that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the pig was unclean! It was a canon of the
Church.</p>

<p class='c004'>The play had more fine dresses in it than
cleverness or substance, but it was received as
warmly as the more deserving performances
during the interludes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Everybody was in high good-humour apparently,
and the next day the paper said it was the most
successful entertainment and supper party Mrs.
Sebberen had ever given, which, coming from such
good authority, must have been the truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the temporary curtain had fallen for the last
time upon general and good-natured applause, a
movement was made toward the supper-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>They put a little round-headed man with weak
eyes to look after Rosalie. He blinked upon her
critically, and then smiled. Rosalie did not like him.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, not being dumb now, she needs must
talk to him; never had anyone been more tongue-tied.
The coldness of the weather, their only
conversation, scarcely matched her conduct to him.
The supper-room was brilliant; nothing had been
spared that money could buy to please the eye or
taste. He forgot her in the contemplation of his
food, and she was glad; it gave her time to look
about.</p>

<p class='c004'>The table was long, and everyone apparently was
seated at it. There was not a plain-looking woman
among the number, so it seemed to her; and many
of them were really beautiful. But Lady Flamington
possessed a certain individual grace, a coldness and
sadness under her exterior charm of manner, that
raised her much above the ordinary plane. Sir
John was sitting by her, and they were talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>pleasantly to one another. She gave one the
impression that she could be very fascinating.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as Rosalie’s eyes travelled up the table on
the opposite side, she recognised Mr. Barringcourt
for the first time that evening, and he was sitting
next to Susiebelle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susiebelle was evidently in good feather, for
everyone had been congratulating her upon her
acting, and she was simple-minded enough to
believe them, which gave her quite a charm. She
was talking to him with great spirit and gaiety, and
looked quite handsome enough to make any mother
proud. Mr. Barringcourt was listening so politely
that his attention seemed to lack interest. When
she laughed he smiled; when she smiled he listened
gravely; when her face was serious, as it rarely was,
he took the opportunity to look around.</p>

<p class='c004'>On one of those occasions his eye travelled across
to where Rosalie sat. No sign of recognition was
visible in them, but a little later he looked at her
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie was annoyed to find that both times
she had been looking at him, and for the future
looked discreetly the other way, nay, cultivated the
acquaintance of her companion, and found him
scarcely as uninteresting as at first she had imagined.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at last the evening was over, and she standing
by Miss Crokerly in the hall, waiting for their
carriage.</p>

<p class='c004'>The coldness of the day had changed to snow,
and the ground outside was white; a sight which
somehow or other always surprises people when first
they see it, however much they may have expected it.
Thick white flakes were still falling rapidly. People
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>drew their wraps round them and shivered, or
pretended to.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lady Flamington’s carriage drove away as Miss
Crokerly and Rosalie reached the top step. Mr.
Barringcourt had seen them off, and closed the
carriage door. Before moving away himself, he
looked up at the steps and saw these two descending.
He raised his hat, looking at Miss Crokerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sir John is not returning home with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she answered anxiously. “He said he
preferred to walk; but I’m sure he can have no idea
of the state of the night. I have not seen him since
before supper-time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll seek him out and bring him to you; it’s a
beastly night.” And he ran lightly up the steps,
whilst they got as quickly under cover as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was not long away, and returned, bringing Sir
John along with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You surely are not walking yourself?” said Miss
Crokerly, as he proceeded to close the door for them
also.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. It never occurred to me to order a carriage,
and I have neither wife nor sister to be concerned
about my getting wet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” said she decidedly, “you must come with
us. I noticed as you went up the steps your shoes
are not at all suitable to the night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed almost as if he would decline, then
suddenly he said “Thank you,” and stepped in
beside Sir John, and they were off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, the frog was so bright that the carriage was
quite pleasantly lit, for it had crept out from beneath
Rosalie’s wraps to its accustomed place.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly then introduced him to Rosalie; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>as he showed no signs of recognition, neither did she,
but leant back in her corner and listened to the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did you think of the theatricals?” asked
Miss Crokerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not arrive in time for them. The secretary
of Todbrook’s Home for Deaf and Dumb came to
see me about a Christmas treat for them. For
myself, I can imagine no treat that would appeal
to incurables. But he has faith in turkey, and I
think he said plum-pudding.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must be a terrible thing to be afflicted with
either defect. What else are you going to do for
them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure. I said I’d call to see
him in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! you should have a Christmas tree, and a
cinematograph, and take them all to the Pantomime
to see the transformation scenes,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>And she sat up again, and her eyes were very
big and bright, because the subject was especially
interesting to her. The other three looked at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you a philanthropist?” asked Mr. Barringcourt,
with a vein of coldness running in his words,
in direct opposition to her heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; but I was told you were,” and leant back
in her seat, and evidently felt safe enough to betray
no outward fear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was speaking last night about your exertions
on behalf of the deaf and dumb,” said Miss Crokerly,
in explanation, recognising, without understanding it,
the tone in each of their voices.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were naturally prepossessed in my favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>then,” and he looked at Rosalie again, speaking in
a voice not free from sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I simply recognised that you were doing
your duty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which you must admit is the hardest of all
things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I take your word for it. From to-day I honour
you as a martyr. I was not prepossessed in your
favour at all. Forgive me for my stupidity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s voice was changed from hot to cold.
Miss Crokerly heard it with surprise, and a silence
must have fallen had not Sir John, whose mind
ranged on different topics, put in suddenly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hear that it is quite true the Great High
Priest intends to resign office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have heard the same thing,” said Mr.
Barringcourt. “It is a very unusual occurrence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you hear the reason of it?” asked Sir
John.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe it has something to do with the
Feast of White Souls. The episode was rather
unfortunate. A great many are in favour of his
resignation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might I ask your opinion?” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I think the Great High Priest should be
above scandal, and he is evidently not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he looked at Rosalie, and his eyes were
laughing, though his face and voice were as serious
as those of a judge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old distaste rose in her, as of some dumb
thing against a cruel and powerful oppressor. But
she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you indulge in scandal, Mr. Barringcourt?
I thought it was the recreation of idle women.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Oh, no,” he answered, with the coolness of
rudeness. “Idle women in these parts are known
by the sharpness of their tongues.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m very sorry,” she answered, suddenly changing
in tone and manner, “but I can’t help liking the
Great High Priest; and as for Golden Priest
Alphonso—I detest him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, dear! dear!” said Miss Crokerly, with
agitation, laying her hand on Rosalie’s knee. “You
must not talk like that, Rosalie, indeed, you must not.
It is not usual. Remember he is Mr. Barringcourt’s
friend, and bears an excellent reputation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But as the carriage drew up, she stopped speaking
of necessity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will drive on, will you not?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, thank you. I’ll get out, and borrow whatever
Miss Crokerly cares to lend me. I never had a cold
in my life. The experience would be new to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So he came with them into the house, and seemed
in no particular hurry to depart. Rosalie said to
him:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you do me a favour, Mr. Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To the best of my ability.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then give me one good point in the character of
your friend.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which friend?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Golden Priest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is a man of great integrity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Honour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s questions were not contemptuous; they
were put with a great desire to find out.</p>

<p class='c004'>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“There you have me,” he answered. “I’m sure I
don’t know. The word generally speaks for itself to
all but the ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you cannot defend him on the strength of
it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; he is clever enough to defend himself, I
hope. You are wearing a very pretty and uncommon
ornament, Miss Paleaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not an ornament. It is alive, and one of my
dearest friends.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Such a friend is rather questionable on Lucifram.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent has a weakness for frogs. In a
natural state they form part of its food.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My friend has powers of self-defence as well as
yours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent has a very big mouth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. And is ambitious enough to prefer men to
frogs upon occasion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed, and the conversation changed to
general topics.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <span class='large'>THE GOLDEN PRIEST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>That night when she and the frog were alone
together, Rosalie began the conversation by saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think of Mr. Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I like him,” said the frog, quite shortly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has prepossessed you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing particularly. But I like him. I’m sorry
you were so rude to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie flushed. The tone was almost grave
enough for a rebuke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I? Rude? Oh, Brightcoat, how can you say so?
I always try to be polite to him, and it always ends
in failure. It is he who is rude to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said the frog; “you take no pains to act or
to speak sensibly. And to say you detest anyone is
absurd, ridiculous, to say nothing of bad manners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve never lived in Marble House, so you can
afford to talk. Talk about vivisection! It was Mr.
Barringcourt who openly deplored to me there was
no such thing in our country. What do you think
of that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are worse things than vivisection,” replied
the frog. “If it were not for that I should never
have been here, or alive now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—” said Rosalie, staring at it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t you cultivate a charming manner,
Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“I expect I’m not made that way. Are my
manners so uncouth?” and her expression was
doleful.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; but I don’t see how you’re to get your six
horses, chariot, and all the rest, unless you try to be
more charming.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Mr. Barringcourt will never help me that
way. You should have seen the look he gave me
last night, and then to-night, as if he’d never seen me
before. Such folk give me quite a creepy feeling.
Besides, talking about horses, his are black. Can’t
you see he is the exact opposite of what I want?
He would do all he could to hinder me. If it were
not that once I saw him looking very tired I should
detest him too. Oh, how I hate Lucifram! Somehow
or other, I never feel at home here,” and she
sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you’ve got about all it can give you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’m like all the rest—ungrateful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie, has it ever struck you you are very
pretty?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; every now and again it has. But what of
that? All the women we saw to-night were pretty.
It’s the commonest of all things. If I’d a big hook
nose now I might appear imposing. But no; even
that is common enough to-day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After a pause the frog said: “I heard someone say
to-night you were the prettiest woman there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Please, don’t! I’d so much rather you left my
personal appearance alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the frog continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s as well for people to think about these things
at times. I know many a lovely woman who has
been ruined by thinking too much of her beauty in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>one way, and too little in another. They know they
are beautiful, and that knowledge is all-sufficient to
them; their food and recreation, and all in all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I’m not one of those.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I think you might put yours to much more
use than you do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You speak in puzzles.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not so dull but that with a little
consideration you will understand me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So Rosalie went to bed much sat on by the frog,
but maybe profiting, as most of us do, from a little
compression and criticism.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next day everything was sloppy, wet, and dismal.
Rain began to fall in the afternoon, and going out, no
matter of pleasure on such a day, was not indulged in.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tea had just been brought in, and Rosalie and
Miss Crokerly were preparing to enjoy it alone, when
visitors were announced. They were Mr. Barringcourt
and the Golden Priest Alphonso.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I came to return the umbrella, Miss Crokerly,
and met the Golden Priest on my way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you will have tea,” said she. “On a wet
day you are doubly welcome. No one else has
ventured out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are fortunate. Miss Paleaf, allow me to
introduce my friend, Golden Priest Alphonso, to
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie, having a severe and cold critic
perched upon her shoulder, rose very gracefully
and bowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must have been very important business that
brought you out on such a day,” said she to him, as
they sat down, with charming sympathy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I was out begging, and a beggar cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>choose his weather. I was going in search of Mr.
Barringcourt for a subscription for a new decorative
curtain for the temple.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In place of the old red one?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly. It was old and shabby, despite its
richness, and we think it must be rotten. There is
every indication that it may give way again, and so
we are making all speed with the new one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you are not superstitious enough to think it
gave way before from anything but natural causes?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at her sharply and narrowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no,” he answered. “One can find a natural
cause for everything. Therein lies the greater
miracle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how?” said Rosalie, subduing her tongue in
deferential attention to the pillar of the Church.</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled, as became one of exalted intellect.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, there is nothing like order—cause and
effect—to work a lasting miracle. A startling thing
has a short life. The rottenness of the curtain was
the symbol of something still more rotten. Nothing
takes place in a day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s eyes opened innocently, though they were
very far from innocent. There is no doubt the frog
must have been to blame for it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is still more rotten? But perhaps my
questions bore you. I am so inquisitive.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again he smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You could never be that. But what is still more
rotten is the system that lets old men continue in
office after they have proved themselves unfit
for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s eyes betrayed a charming depth of
horror at this cold-blooded statement.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“But, sir,” said she, “who is to be the judge of
their incapacity? And, again, it seems so cruel, and—and—doesn’t
it make a terrible lot of enemies for
you, saying things like that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Golden Priest laughed. The last remark
evidently was to some point.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the cause of common sense one has no
objection to making enemies. And I cannot for
the life of me see why the highest position in the
land should never be filled by a man till he’s
nearly in his dotage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! it’s more restful. Besides, a great and a
good man should retain his intellect to his death,
however old and feeble he may be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Granted! But feebleness is no qualification for
an important post. And greatness and goodness
should discern its own capacity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it true, then, that the Great High Priest is
resigning?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; in a few months.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has discernment, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think his action is a little too late for that.
His plea is ill-health. None of us have heard
anything further—not those nearest to him in
office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then there will come the general election
for his successor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>(For in Lucifram they chose their highest priests
that way. The clergy vote for them.)</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; in a few weeks from now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be a very distracting time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Scarcely more so than the last year has
been.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so the silent plot of years had worked to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>fulfilment, the veil or mask at length being thrown
aside. To-day was spoken openly what a month
ago had been whispered and kept down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the conversation was interrupted by Miss
Crokerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Barringcourt tells me he saw the secretary
again this morning, and arranged for all the things
you suggested, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. He has never doubted my judgment before,
but I think he must have detected a foreign influence,
he looked so dubious.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are they to have force-meat and sausages with
the turkey, do you know?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It never occurred to me to ask.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you an executor of a will! And never to
inquire about the gravy and bread-sauce. It’s plain
you don’t attach enough importance to a Christmas
dinner. But if I were you, Mr. Barringcourt, I’d
countermand all orders, and give them 3s. 6d. each,
and a free day to enjoy themselves anywhere and
anyhow, with a night each end, to make a complete
sandwich and a delightful holiday.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You imagine them to be prisoners. On the contrary,
those who have friends or relations who care
to receive them may have leave from the Home once
every month. And for the inmates, you must
remember it is no prison that they live in, and they
are very happy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose so,” said Rosalie. “But I always dread
those public institutions for defects.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are prejudiced,” put in the Golden Priest.
“They are the greatest blessings in existence. I
always regard them as branches of the temple.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“So do I,” said Mr. Barringcourt; but the tone was
questionable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have the greatest longing to go through
Todbrook’s Home,” said Miss Crokerly. “One hears
so much about it. I should like to see the inmates
at work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie shivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! would you, Miss Crokerly? I can imagine
nothing more galling to them than to be watched by
strangers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But is it such an infliction to them?” asked that
lady, turning to Mr. Barringcourt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” said he. “I hardly think
so. I think myself it would be better if they
had more visitors from the outside world. Lady
Flamington is the only lady I have ever taken
over the premises.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had just left there,” said the Golden Priest,
“before I met you to-day. I hear she caught a severe
chill last night, and is confined to her room.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed,” said Miss Crokerly; and Mr. Barringcourt
and Rosalie looked at each other, from no apparent
motive.</p>

<p class='c004'>When tea was over the two gentlemen rose to go.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think,” said Mr. Barringcourt, in a lower voice,
to Rosalie, as the others were speaking of a special
fern which both were rearing—“I think it would not
be a bad plan for you to go over the Home with Miss
Crokerly. The matron will willingly take you over,
and you’ll find there are worse things in the world
than being deaf and dumb, or even blind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then somehow or other they looked at each other,
the first time really since the Saturday night. How
long ago it seemed now! And each was very curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>about the other evidently, for Rosalie’s eyes searched
his, and his eyes hers, but what conclusion either
came to it would be hard to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then she shook hands with the Golden Priest,
and the door closed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think,” said Miss Crokerly, “that Mr.
Barringcourt told the Golden Priest your opinion of
him, and brought him here to-day in consequence?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I don’t think so,” she replied thoughtfully.
“I think Mr. Barringcourt must have recognised the
Golden Priest has no sense of humour, and would
resent instead of forgiving opinions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your tone proves appearances are deceptive. I
thought by your manner you had changed your
estimate of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie half shuddered, and stretched her hands to
the blaze.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was simply carrying out a lesson in obedience.
And yet my estimate of him <em>has</em> changed. I find
him so uninteresting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is the common lot of most of us to be
uninteresting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no, indeed. You are interesting; so is Sir
John; so was—was—so have been many people I have
met—Mr. Barringcourt, for instance. But this man is
petrified by ambition. It is eating up his heart and
head.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I am not particularly fond of him myself,
as I have told you. Still, I am surprised that
with your views you should find Mr. Barringcourt
interesting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s brows knitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand him. I never did understand
him. Have you ever met anyone, Miss Crokerly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>who at times struck you as being very, very good, and
at others almost cruel? And that is how he appears
to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you know so little of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, of course. I forgot. I spoke as if we were
almost old acquaintances.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <span class='large'>CONVERSATION AND A LITTLE PIG-STUFF</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>After that a short time passed away, during which
Rosalie saw much of Mr. Barringcourt and the Golden
Priest, though not intimately.</p>

<p class='c004'>During this time Lady Flamington, young, beautiful,
much courted and admired, died. It caused a
great sensation at the time, because she had only
been ill a week, and the doctor had great hopes of
recovery because she was strong. But it was double
pneumonia, and whereas many a poor person less
well attended to gets well and strong again, she, with
all attention, passed away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie, though knowing comparatively little of
her, was somehow much affected by her death. Sir
John went to the funeral, and she was put away in a
manner that would have done many a poor person’s
heart good.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next morning was bright and frosty, and
Rosalie took an early walk in the Park. Walking
there, she met Mr. Barringcourt, and as it was
daylight, and the frog was with her, she did not beat
a retreat. She expected to find him doleful, searched
his face for the usual signs, but found nothing. She
remembered Mariana’s words, and thought there
must be truth in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are out early,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I left Miss Crokerly feeding the birds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>cleaning the cages. She prefers to do it alone, so I
don’t offer to help her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are happier with her than you were with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course. I was not at all happy with you, Mr.
Barringcourt. You knew it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think you waited long enough to find out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I escaped by the first open door, in case none
other should present itself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which door was that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is my little secret. You must be as
charming as charming to me, and I will be sure
never to let you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “Mariana again?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, Mariana,” said Rosalie, suddenly standing
still and looking up at him, for they had walked along
together. “How is Mariana? I want to see her
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, she is perfectly well, I think,” he answered.
“But you cannot see her. The guest of Sir John
Crokerly cannot fraternise with a housemaid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When did you find me a snob?” asked Rosalie.
“Of course I can see her. I—I should have written
and asked her to call and see me, only things in your
house aren’t quite on the highest principle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie’s nose went one degree higher, and she
drew her skirts more severely round her, and moved
quite half an inch further away as they walked along.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, the postman would do his part of the work,
but I doubt whether Everard would.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, if you don’t trust Everard, why not call
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s eyes opened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean to say if I wouldn’t trust a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>I should trust myself? How you reason, Mr.
Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You could neither be torn up nor burned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. But it is my firm intention never to enter
Marble House again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are the young lady who once said you never
had run away, and never intended to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her ears began to burn.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To recall things that are past is mean—and—and
abominable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not recalling things. I merely wish to
point out to you people always do the things they
say they won’t do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do they?” she answered, and turned a pair of
mermaid eyes on to his profile, and tried to recall
things that he had said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under the scrutiny he turned his face to her again,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still the old trick of staring, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must be very careful how you speak to me.
See, I carry my chaperon in my muff,” and she
tilted it up and showed the frog sitting there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you had lived two hundred years ago, they’d
have called that little animal your familiar spirit, and
burnt you as a witch. Where did you get it from?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another secret, Mr. Barringcourt. You must be
still more charming, and I’ll count twenty every time
before I speak. But when may I see Mariana?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana has forgotten you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has she married Everard, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! Their friendship is as pleasant as iced
milk in summer. If you want to see Mariana, you
must come and seek her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie bit her lip. “I’ve told you I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because if I came you’d never let me out
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You say so, so I should be very ill-mannered
if I contradicted you. My road lies this way.
Good morning!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” and he turned to find her standing there,
with a puzzled and anxious look on her face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you mind giving me a little advice—telling
me what to do, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s about a handkerchief that was found in the
temple, so it seems, some time ago. It belonged to
me. I keep wondering ought I to tell, and I don’t
want to. I would have asked Miss Crokerly, only
she knows nothing about it, and might not understand.
What would you do if you were me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d worry; but being myself, I’d let it pass.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it caused a scandal, and did the Great High
Priest a great deal of harm.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you not speak about it at the time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because I wasn’t in Lucifram. I—I—I—You
see, I haven’t got out of my old habit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he answered, and raised his hat and turned
away again, and spoke with such a short kind of
pride, that just the one sharp monosyllable was
almost more than Rosalie could stand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There now,” said she to the frog, as they walked
home, she with a burning heart. “Do you like him
now? Did I not tell you no one could be nastier?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” replied Brightcoat, “you ask advice, and
only give half the information—not that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see you have conspired against me. If I told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>him the story of the Governor, and how I met with
you, he would only laugh and say I was dreaming.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shouldn’t stammer when you’re speaking.
People always misconstrue it, and give it more
meaning than it has.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because people are so stupid. Well, we’ve
quarrelled again now, and you can blame me if
you like; but I blame him. And I would so love
to see Mariana again. And to think he called her
a housemaid! Housemaid? I’ve seen no woman
to compare to her in beauty or grace since I came
here. The only thing she needed was life. And
housemaids, as a rule, have too much of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is sad to relate that a few days after this the
Great High Priest died, and his death was a general
relief. He was little mourned for. The public do
not always forgive a man readily, even when he has
the grace to die, though it’s certainly a great point in
his favour. But still there was a certain section still
in his favour, or rather, in favour of a certain Golden
Priest called Phillipus, who was the oldest of that
superior gathering, and likeliest, therefore, to come
soonest upon dotage. Now Phillipus, if seniority
had anything to do with it, ought to have stepped
into the vacant throne, and would have done, if the
events of the last two years or so had not undermined
public feeling.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was a man of sixty, so well preserved, and of
an intellect so keen, he appeared as one in the very
middle youth of life. But when events are against a
man, he may be what he will, he doesn’t make much
headway, from a worldly point of view.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the death of the High Priest, so unexpected as
it was, threw things forward a bit. The election for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>his successor must come off sooner than was expected.
In lieu of this, a famous conclave was called together
at a dinner-party—a party at which the dinner was
not to be so important as the speeches to follow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whilst this was in progress of preparation, cards
of invitation were issued for a great ball in Marble
House on Christmas Day.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so it was the day before the big dinner came
off, and about a week after the invitations for the ball
had been issued, Susiebelle rushed into the drawing-room
of her great friend, Miss Groggerton.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, before proceeding, it may be as well to
introduce this lady cautiously. She lived in Lucifram,
not upon Earth. She was so shockingly and vulgarly
outspoken that on our modest sphere she would
never have been tolerated; but there she was.</p>

<p class='c004'>And why? Well, the reason is a good one. She
had twice been crossed in love. That on Earth
makes a woman bitter. Not so on Lucifram.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crossed once, she does become embittered;
crossed twice, she becomes a scourge in the land.
And Miss Groggerton had been crossed twice.</p>

<p class='c004'>She therefore spared no one, man, woman, or child,
and in consequence all persons with a spite against
anyone went to her. She poured pepper and vinegar
upon their wounds; then salt, and healed them.</p>

<p class='c004'>So it was that Susiebelle rushed into her room,
furnished in yellow satin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think it’s shameful!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s shameful?” asked Miss Groggerton,
laying down her yellow-backed novel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The way Camille Barringcourt has behaved!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I knew you’d never manage it,” said the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Manage what?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“To get him up to the scratch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve failed often enough; you needn’t talk to
me.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was talking to myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s scandalous the way that grey-haired old
Agnes Crokerly gets into everything. The reason
her brother’s never got married is because she
never lets him out of her sight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The reason he’s never got married,” said Miss
Groggerton, “is because he’s no morals.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know a good bit about people,” said
Susiebelle, more respectfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should think I did! People are no better than
pigs; they’re swine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pa made his money out of pigs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re one degree better than people, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish you’d let me say what I came to say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go on. No one’s hindering you but yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Camille Barringcourt’s a pig. He’s gone and
asked old Agnes Crokerly to play hostess at his big
do. And I thought now Lady Flamington was gone
there’d be a chance for ma and me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What d’ye want with <em>him</em>?” said the other
sneeringly. “He’s not a duke. He’s plain Mr.!
Bless me, you’re coming down!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! but he’s got a mint of money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got enough money for two and more, if
need be. What you want is a title. If you looked
back into his people you’d find they kept a chip
potato shop, I dare be bound.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never!” said Susiebelle, with emphasis, the tears
rising in her eyes. “He’s so real a gentleman he
makes Lord Hysquint look like a twopence-halfpenny
waiter in a restaurant I don’t want a duke” (her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>voice was rising), “I won’t have a duke! They’re
common little sniggling things that are too proud
for their place. One might think they’d never tasted
sausage! I’ll marry who I want to, and if I don’t
marry who I want, I’ll make everybody’s life a burden
to them!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And her voice rose to a high pitch, for she was
hysterical, and had never been much crossed in her
life before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Groggerton was enjoying the oratory so
much, she made no attempt at interruption. This
would be a delightful tale for repetition. Susiebelle,
once having begun to speak, had lost control over
her tongue, a state with which many will readily
sympathise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I went to the temple specially when Lady
Flamington died, and thanked the Serpent, because
I thought it was my turn next, and—and—and now
it’s old Agnes Crokerly—old cat!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Old Agnes Crokerly!” said Miss Groggerton,
with a snort and a sneer. “Old Agnes Crokerly!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he’s asked her to do the thing for him.
And he giving a big affair with Lady Flamington
warm in her coffin yet! And never a crape band
round his arm or his hat for her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well! Women who make themselves too cheap
can’t expect to be respected even in their graves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She never made herself too cheap. Ma fought
tooth and nail to get her to our place, and wouldn’t
have managed it then if it hadn’t been for Mr.
Barringcourt, who’s more democratic in his views.
He brought her to a charity concert when her
husband was away in the land of Big Boasts and
Loud Voices, and ma improved the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“And now,” said the other contemptuously, “you
say John Crokerly’s sister has taken her place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; it’s the way with young men. Mollycoddled
by women old enough to be their mothers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her tears began to flow again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s not so very young,” said Miss Groggerton
impressively. “And you bet your bottom dollar it’s
the other one he’s after.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which other?” and Susiebelle opened her big
brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s her name? Pa—Pa—Paleaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” screamed the other. “The girl with
the pug-nose, the green eyes and washed-out hair.
Sprung from nowhere! A lot you know about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know plenty, because I watch. Didn’t I see
them walking in the Park the other morning? I’ll
do him the justice, though, to say she kept calling him
back when he was all for getting away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe it. She knows how to dress, and
there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s a right-down pretty woman,” said Miss
Groggerton spitefully, who would have been just as
eager to pronounce her ugly upon another occasion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s no dash, no ‘go’ about her. She gives
one the impression she’s been sleeping in a bandbox.
I’d rather have Agnes for company than her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You would. But then you’re not a man. It
makes all the difference.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then Susiebelle, being quite overwrought, put
her head on the sofa pillow and cried aloud. Truly
Miss Groggerton was cruel. But it was not her
nature to remain so long, if justice must be done her.
Suddenly she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you very gone on Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“Dead gone. If I don’t marry him I’ll marry no
one. So pa had better look out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s Miss Paleaf he’s gone upon now, though
it may be only a passing fancy. But why not set
yourself to work to do her out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How?” asked Susiebelle, raising her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, she never goes anywhere but what she
takes a hideous green toad with her. These are days
of extreme religion. Let’s say she worships it.
There would be scandal in no time, and it might
end seriously for her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but I’m thinking of him. I don’t think
he’s a very religious man. It might make no
difference to him if he’s f—f—fond of her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Groggerton laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll never get married if you’re such a greenhorn.
D’ye think any man would care for a girl
who worshipped a toad when he was there himself
to be worshipped? On my word, Susiebelle, you
don’t know everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not,” said the other humbly. “How—how
shall we begin?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! I have a great friend, a priest called James
Peter. I’ll speak of it to him as a serious matter and
scandal. There’s no one like the priests for spreading
gossip.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <span class='large'>AFTER-DINNER SPEECHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>After that Susiebelle went back to her accustomed
life, and behaved as a young lady who had been
presented to the Emperor <em>should</em> behave.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great night of the dinner had arrived; the
following day was to be the great election, and the
two most popular and powerful candidates were, to
even the inexperienced eye, Golden Priest Alphonso
and his brother Phillipus.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, since the death of the Great High Priest it
was very plain the latter had come into more favour.
Why, it would be hard to say. A little whisper here,
a little whisper there. “He is ambitious”—deadliest
sin in a path of life that fosters ambition. And
Golden Priest Alphonso, with his far-reaching,
numerous feelers, like the octopus, must have been
conscious of it. Yet the poor were his upholders.
One night a week, at his own board, they were his
guests, and he was seen sitting down with them.
<em>This</em> man ambitious? The people’s friend Alphonso!
That means so little and so much, just as in the days
of our own French Revolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now the night had come, and everything was
a buzz of simmering excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thanks to tickets sent from Mr. Barringcourt,
probably through Golden Priest Alphonso, Sir John,
Miss Crokerly, and Rosalie were enabled to go. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Sebberens only got one ticket, as happened in most
houses, and that at a side table, still a place of
honour, where the wealthiest sat, and were content to
sit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Golden Priests, robed in their flowing vestments
of richest satin and cloth of gold, sat
interspersed amongst their guests, at the two
principal tables. The great hall was crowded, and
so constructed that all speakers, from one end to
the other, could be distinctly heard when there was
silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was an off-shoot of the great temple, and was
called the Golden Hall because its ceiling, walls, and
other adornments were overlaid with gold. Men
were there in the preponderance, but there were
women also from the more influential houses.
People were heard lamenting the absence of Lady
Flamington. Somehow or other to-night, even in
that tumultuous world, her presence was missed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie was there. Rosalie, in shimmering grey,
like frozen shining <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêpe</span></i>, only soft and clinging. She
was as one in half mourning among that brilliant
throng. On her shoulder was the shining frog,
shining in green and white, and for some reason or
other her face was very pale, and her eyes big and
bright.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the opposite side, a little farther up the table,
Mr. Barringcourt sat. He wore the curious gleaming
jewelled pin she had seen before, and the persistent
red light it cast was nothing short of wonderful. On
the side lower down sat Golden Priest Alphonso.
Still farther off sat Phillipus. To-morrow the race
and the fight would be decided.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now on this great occasion the Golden Priests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>themselves did not speak. Naturally, a man cannot
speak on his own behalf. The only thing he can
speak for is a Cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when dinner was over (and it was finished in a
remarkably short time, being, as it were, but the
trumpet sound calling to greater things), the friends
and upholders of each candidate spoke in turn. No
names were mentioned—views only were put forward,
facts also. Each speaker was allowed fifteen minutes
and no more.</p>

<p class='c004'>The speeches began in earnest, and they revolved
round the two chief men of those chosen—for and
against.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now it was plain that the unfortunate episode of
the lost handkerchief, or rather <em>found</em> one, still
rankled deeply in people’s minds. A debt of
gratitude was still due to the man who discovered
and made known this scandalous piece of information.
Affairs in the temple had for centuries been
kept too close. A Great High Priest was needed
whose actions would be as light as day, and character
above reproach.</p>

<p class='c004'>So on the speeches went, all interesting and
conclusive, because they all pivoted on one concrete
thing, a handkerchief with a rose in the corner. The
thing itself was never mentioned, for that would
scarce have been diplomacy. Like the Serpent,
the handkerchief was hidden out of sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>And so on one little lie, or piece of misunderstanding,
one man was gaining a position which clearly
was too good for him. So at least thought Rosalie.
She studied the faces of the two candidates, and took
a sudden fancy to that of Phillipus. He came from
a line of uncrowned kings. The speeches were going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>against him; he bore it with dignity and polite
attention to every speaker.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last one speaker, bold with champagne, ran full
tilt at the red rag, rose, or whatever else it can be
called. He spoke of it openly, and the result was—fatal.</p>

<p class='c004'>For suddenly the frog said to Rosalie, “Speak!”
and being obedient, she spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>She rose to her feet with one deep spot of colour
flaming into either cheek, the rest white as snow. A
curious silence fell on the room, which had been
silent before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think there has been a little misunderstanding
about the handkerchief,” she said, in a voice that
ceased to tremble. “It belongs to me. I never saw
the Great High Priest in my life, but I did go into
the most sacred place three years ago, with—with a
petition, and by mistake I left it there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now there was a certain purity in Rosalie’s voice
and simplicity in the words that carried conviction.</p>

<p class='c004'>For half a minute silence followed, then Golden
Priest Alphonso broke the silent spell.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What right had you going there? You! A
woman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—I was very much in earnest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” said he harshly and pitilessly, “you are to
blame for all the events of the past three years.”
Then his voice altered, and he said: “Truth is
pleasant. It is a relief to find the late High Priest
was better than one thought. But you, what excuse
is there for you, to keep silence so long, and let a
man go to his grave misunderstood? Fear, I presume,
of being found out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I knew nothing,” said Rosalie, in a kind of self-defence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>for the expression in his eyes under the
hypocritical sternness was very sinister. And then
someone hissed at the far end of the room, and then
someone else. Truly the Serpent was alive, and no
golden image either.</p>

<p class='c004'>But hissing was contrary to the dictates of good
manners in such an assembly, and the chairman called
to order. Rosalie sat down trembling, all colour gone
from her face, though she had sufficient strength of
will to keep her from giving any further signs of the
ordeal she had passed through. Her eyes travelled
magnetically from the face of the Golden Priest to
that of Mr. Barringcourt.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was leaning forward, his elbow on the table,
looking at her. In his eyes shone the old mocking,
laughing light, that said in so many silent words,
“Now you’ve put your foot into it.” They showed
no sympathy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then a man, seizing the opportunity, got up and
spoke in favour of Phillipus; another, then another.
The tide seemed turning—was turning. Rosalie sat
as an icicle. Every now and again she felt the sinister
eyes from below, the laughing ones from above, fixed
on her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Who would have thought the popularity of a man
hung on such a little thing as a handkerchief?</p>

<p class='c004'>Then at last Mr. Barringcourt got up. In the
midst of passion and eloquence, he was passionless.
In spite of his height, in spite of his deep, unfathomable
eyes, in spite of his firm mouth and certain lines upon
his face, he seemed to be by far the youngest who
had spoken, in manner, in voice, in a certain
confident easiness. People settled in their places,
smiled when he smiled, and became suddenly more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>good-natured, for at times he had a very bewitching
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at him. She recognised that in
Lucifram she had never seen so handsome a man, or
one with so much grace. A dull pain and a sharp
pain struck at her heart together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said he, for on these
occasions titles were disregarded by the speaker,
“the record speech of the evening has been delivered
by a lady with a style and simplicity it would be
impossible for us to beat.” (Popular opinion
fluctuated. Was Rosalie so bad as five minutes
before they had imagined? The speaker spoke so
easily, he made them feel more easy. Wonderful gift
of oratory!) “Now I agree with my friend, the
Golden Priest Alphonso, the lady should have spoken
earlier, when things could have been righted. But
her silence no doubt sprang from the best intentions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s all very well,” called a voice. “But what
about going into the sacred place against orders?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When one is in earnest, one goes much farther
than one intends. It’s an unconscious action. The
lady said she was in earnest; she has accounted for
what she did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s liable to severe punishment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So then are all the women who looked at the
Serpent when the curtain fell. I remember hearing
a conversation between two sisters who were present
at that—that unfortunate service. One fainted, the
other retained presence of mind. Since then they
have scarcely spoken—one was enabled to see so
much more than the other. It is generally acknowledged
that all women worthy the name did what
was natural.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Whether Mr. Barringcourt were laughing or no,
there were few there who took him anything but
seriously. They considered this the acme of perfection
in simplicity of reasoning, for the time, at
any rate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” continued he, “to return to the general
subject, the choice of a Great High Priest. It
seems to me the greatest fault in the past has been
the age of the chosen candidate. What one wants at
the head of such a great organisation as the Church
is younger men—younger blood—younger principles
and ideas.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dissentient voices.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t agree with me. But lately I was
travelling in Lucifram in a country of world-wide
respect and renown. It surprised me at first to find
all the places of importance filled by comparatively
young men—State, Church, professions, even trades.
In the centre of their chief city I saw a famous statue
in marble of a man, and underneath in letters of
gold was carved ‘Aged sixty-five.’ There was no
mistaking it; the smallest child could read and
understand it. On seeing this I made inquiries,
and was told his history by the High Sheriff,
himself a man of about fifty-five.</p>

<p class='c004'>“His name was Hugo de Bretton, and as a lad he
had been an errand boy, and in that capacity
acquired an unfailing stock of good manners and
alertness, the necessary adjuncts to all successful
men who are not boors. From thence he travelled
the ordinary roads of success till, in due course, he
became a great banker. His own fortune was enormous—his
power equalled it. This at fifty. At sixty
his wealth was increased. At sixty-five he seemed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the very zenith of his glory—physically and mentally
of astounding strength. His name a magic spell
in speculations. Then suddenly he resigned from
public life.” Here a shrewd little smile, almost
imperceptible, wrinkled Mr. Barringcourt’s face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, you know,” continued he, “that a man who
amasses a fortune, a very great fortune, I will not say
how great, does the greater part of it by stepping on
other people’s corns—not intentionally, but he does
step all the same. And with increasing gold his feet
at times become so heavy they do more than crush
corns—they crush life unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This man was no fool. The past had been very
profitable years to him; so should the future be.
How great a sacrifice his self-resignation was it
would be hard to say, but it was done with little
ostentation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He lived for a period of fifteen years longer, and,
I venture to say, in that time he did more practical
good than any statesman or soldier of his time.
He gave of the accumulated experience of life,
generously and widely. He invested large sums
for the aid of respected and aged poor, a thing
which hitherto had been thought to be the work
of the poorhouses. He spent the last years of
his life a philosopher and philanthropist, respected
and beloved—leaving the outward battle of life for
those who had still to win their spurs. So great was
the impression left by his conduct that others, lesser
men or equal, followed suit. And gradually the law
came in that all at sixty-five resigned their office, not
as unfit for work, but as having done their full share
of labour in the field—ready to give advice when
sought, and ready to turn a life’s experience into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>profitable channel for the good of the community.
And with such critics standing by, capable of
judging, and unsparingly, it acted as a spur to the
generation following.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so it is that age is there the most respected.
Generation of workers follows generation in perfect
order. In State, in Church, in every division of labour
there is vigour and freshness. For why is the Church
to be excluded? On the plea of sacred exemption?
A most sacred fallacy that is so ticklish it won’t bear
touching, and holds together pretty much as the old
crimson curtain in the temple held, till the hand of
God, through the agency of moths, tore it down from
the rings of gold.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s many a man young at sixty-five,” one
argued.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I not given you a notable example of
one who turned his mind from business to philanthropy,
and gave his mind and energy and wealth
to it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s many a man has died soon after giving
up the business of his life, if it’s compulsory.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s either narrow-minded, with no interest
outside his own affairs, or he worships his work
above the Serpent. He should be careful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Many of our finest clergy are over the age you
mention.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They push out or keep down the younger men
who are just as fine. If they wish to remain in office
after age, let them work for the love of the thing—for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he sat down. And not long afterwards the
guests departed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“What a curious speech that was of Mr. Barringcourt’s,”
said Miss Crokerly to her brother, as they
drove home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. He’d argue black was white when in a
mood to do so. But I’ll call on him to-morrow.
According to his verdict, there’s only three years
good work left in me now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He didn’t say that,” put in Rosalie from her
corner, where she had been sitting mutely. “Just
think, Sir John! Under certain conditions you
might paint the best picture you ever did in your
life after sixty-five, and what a great thing it would
be if you gave the proceeds to some great scheme of
general improvement, that had too much genuine
good to have any of the sentimentalism of charity
in it. I think it would be a splendid thing, and
economise resources.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Under the new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i> we’ll have to become
Spartans,” said he, not unkindly. “But tell me,
Rosalie, is it true that the lost handkerchief belonged
to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she answered, breathing quickly and leaning
forward. “I went there one day, nay, twice, when I
was in terrible distress. I never mentioned it before;
I didn’t quite know how to. But some day I’ll tell
you all, but at present I would rather not. Has it
made any difference to you? I had to speak to-night.
It has weighed so long on my mind. And I couldn’t
bear to hear them bringing that up as a blot on the
late High Priest’s life. If it had not been so cruel, it
would have been ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We wish to know no more than you care to tell
us,” he answered kindly. “And it has made no
difference. The time was awkward, certainly, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>you had not been here long enough to know how
things were going,”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! but it’s Mr. Barringcourt,” she continued
quickly, with a queer ring of pain in her voice. “He
knew, and has known all along, and could have spoken
and set all things right. It was cruel, cruel! I can’t
understand that anyone who spoke as he spoke
to-night could act as he has done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did he know about the handkerchief?” said Miss
Crokerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He must have done. He—he—he was at the
temple the same time as I. If only he had spoken
sincerely! But it was simply to further the schemes
of an ambitious man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they got home Miss Crokerly went up with
Rosalie to bed. A fire was burning brightly in the
bedroom.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie, did you ever know Mr. Barringcourt
before you met him at the Sebberens’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed. I stayed in his house nearly a
week. I met him first in the sacred place of the
temple.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why were you staying at his house?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at her with the look of fear and
pain in her eyes that had haunted them half the
night.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I tell you, you’ll never repeat it, even to your
brother?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I was born dumb, and I remained dumb
till I was twenty-two, and then he cured me
completely, just as I am now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly would have doubted, but Rosalie’s
tone carried conviction as before.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“And it took a week for the cure to be completed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Afterwards he kept me as a prisoner. I
ran away, or something led me away. I don’t know
which.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a curious tale. Almost unbelievable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know. That’s why I never repeat it. I should
have gone to be an inmate of Todbrook’s Home, but
I couldn’t bear the thought of it, somehow or
other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Miss Crokerly went away. She saw that
Rosalie was overwrought and tired, and recommended
her to think about nothing till morning, and go to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the door was closed, Rosalie flung herself
down in a chair before the fire, and the frog hopped
on to the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you tell me to speak?” she cried. “I
did no good. Only incurred cold glances and hisses
and hatred.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Flea bites,” said the frog.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bred out of serpent’s poison, anyway. If I’d
followed Mr. Barringcourt’s advice I’d have said
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He always goes by the rule of contrary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a rule I never learnt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s answerable for a great deal that happens in
this world. Why do you take things so much to
heart?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I don’t know. I’m a lonely, lonely woman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m a lonely, lonely frog.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed. “You make light of my misfortunes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think you are much more fortunate than you
think. I bear a charmed life, and yours is the next
best thing. We’ll struggle on together, anyhow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Remember, we’re in search of six white horses and a
capable driver. That’s all we’ve got to mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” said Rosalie. “Life’s more like a
dream than reality.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the frog yawned, and Rosalie, much soothed,
was soon asleep.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>Next day this particular city of Lucifram was
buzzing. The great election was coming off. Yet
there was no doubt who was winning. Golden Priest
Alphonso had regained his old popularity. When
the poll was read at night he headed the list. The
people received it with shouts of acclamation. In
other circles the news was as well received. He was
barely forty. A precedent was established. He was
the youngest Great High Priest in the record of time.</p>

<p class='c004'>But our history is not so much with public events
as private persons, and we return once more to
Susiebelle and her friend Miss Groggerton.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither of them had been at the great dinner, but
the one had heard from her father, and the other read
from the paper, the trend of general events.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And,” said Susiebelle, with pious horror, “to
admit right out she’d been into the most sacred
place—a place no woman has ever been in before.
Such impudent boldness is enough to make one’s hair
stand on end. She’s a disgrace to our sex. If I met
her in the street with the Emperor himself I’d turn
my head away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As this was never likely to be, Susiebelle was very
safe.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but what I can’t understand is Mr. Barringcourt’s
conduct,” said Miss Groggerton. “I hear that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>he defended her, or the next best thing. Made
everyone laugh and then serious at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Groggerton was green when she said it, but
Susiebelle became greener.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pa says no right-minded woman would care to
hear her conduct made the subject of open criticism,
and if she’d had a ha’porth of modesty, she’d have
kept her tongue still. But I know the kind she is.
Those pug-nosed women are all alike. Pushing
themselves to the front if they have to pay body and
soul for it. Have you seen brother James Peter
yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. He called the day before yesterday. And
I explained to him about her. He was to be at the
dinner last night, so he would see her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Just at this moment, in accordance with the old
proverb, brother James Peter made his appearance.
He has been previously introduced to the reader at
the beginning of this book. Once brother James
Peter fell over a footstool, and got lost in the dark,
was laughed at by his brother priests, and to this day
heard occasional remarks made about his conduct.
He remembered very well the source of his misfortunes,
and had again scented the innocent cause of
them all. He was the first to hiss last night, proving
himself to be a true cross-breed of the Serpent.
To-day he came in as one with news. He had given
his vote; for him the day’s work was over.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You look pale, Sir Priest,” said Miss Groggerton,
who would have called up the devil to prove him
another, behind his back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The events of last night have distracted me,” he
cried, sitting down. And Miss Groggerton rang for his
favourite collation of whisky and ham sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Tell us, is it true?” they both cried, as the
provisions were being prepared without.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That woman is in the power of the Evil One,” said
he solemnly. “And the sooner that little squat
animal is taken by the hind leg and cast into the
fire—the—better.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed,” said Miss Groggerton, in joyful
anticipation of slaughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe it’s that frog that gets her a reputation
for beauty. Loathsome little thing!” and Susiebelle
shivered, and then laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Listen to me,” said James Peter, raising his fat
finger. “Make none of your own little spiteful
remarks, but listen to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Being a priest, he spoke as one in authority, and
the women submitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That woman,” said he, “is a dangerous and
unprincipled character. Three years ago—listen
carefully—she came into our temple and pretended to
be drunk—dumb, I mean. She used to come and
kneel up close to the crimson curtain, and I believe
she contaminated it and made it rot. She used to
look up at me with her lovely eyes (she has lovely
eyes, Mademoiselle Susiebelle, whatever you may
think), and point to her lips, and shake her head, and
I—I used to pity her. She gave me to understand
she was praying for the gift of speech.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the women laughed shrilly, shook with
laughing, as he had laughed long since.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that,” continued he, “was all a ruse. She
was waiting her opportunity to slip inside the curtain,
eaten up with preternatural and unwomanly curiosity.
But one afternoon, as it was getting dusk, I went into
the choir stalls to get a psalter that I needed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>thought I heard a curious sound coming from out
the sacred place. I could not understand it. I hid
myself in the shadow of the carved screen, suspecting
theft, and recognising sacrilege. A little later, out
came this woman, carrying a light. I know not
where she got it from. But seeing me, she ran all
down the nave at quickest speed, I following.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You caught her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The devil helped her. She escaped; and at the
door she turned right round and put her tongue right
out at me, and said: ‘Did you ever know a woman
who couldn’t talk if she wanted to?’ You have the
story in a nutshell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you never reported it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three hours afterwards. I was as one imprisoned
in a living grave for three long weary
hours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But did you not tell?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; and the Great High Priest would not
believe me. He laughed. That was the beginning
of all his troubles. He was too lax, they say. Under
the new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i> there will be greater strictness.” And
he sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, she’s a witch, a witch—an impudent,
underbred thing,” said Susiebelle excitedly. “Have
you told Mr. Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not personally acquainted with him. But
last night, from the way he spoke, one might almost
have thought he was excusing her. Of course, there
was no putting out of tongues or giving pert answers
last night; she spoke as meek and as mildly as you
please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it hadn’t have come from the mouth of a
clergyman I wouldn’t have believed it of her,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>said Miss Groggerton, glad to have such a reliable
source of information.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—but” continued Susiebelle, “isn’t there a
severe punishment for going inside the curtain, for a
woman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It used to be to have her tongue torn out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who will do it? Who will do it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one will do it nowadays. The biggest
punishment would be a fine. Pawn a few jewels;
it’s done in no time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She doesn’t worship the Serpent at all; she
worships that little blinking frog,” said Miss
Groggerton.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ve got my eye on her. And if there are
any heathenish practices going on, you may be sure
I will report them before long,” said he, and soon
afterwards got up to go.</p>

<p class='c004'>That same night, when all the wear and tear and
excitement of the day were over, and all the cabs had
rattled home, and all the theatres been closed, the
new Great High Priest sat in an arm-chair in Mr.
Barringcourt’s study, whilst the owner sat in his
accustomed one beside the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sacred Priest Alphonso was white and haggard,
and the deep lines on his face showed the strain that
he had passed through. His arms hung heavily on
the arms of the chair, his eyes were fixed on the
carpet. Mr. Barringcourt was writing a letter. When
he had finished it, he sealed it, and tossed it on the
table, then bent his eyes upon his guest as a doctor
sometimes does upon an uncertain patient he treats as
an experiment. Without saying anything, he got up,
and went to a side-table, and poured out two glasses
of red wine. One he filled, the other only half, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>turned his head round and looked at the Priest.
Still he sat in the same weary lethargy. A smile
curved Mr. Barringcourt’s lips. “Very far gone,” he
muttered, and filled the glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he took it across and offered it to him. He
took it carelessly and drank all the contents. Mr.
Barringcourt drank half his and flung the rest into the
fire. It blazed up in a brilliant red light, then died
away as suddenly, leaving the fire dark, as if water had
been poured on it. But this beverage must have
refreshed the High Priest wonderfully; for suddenly
rousing himself, he looked up at Mr. Barringcourt,
and said, slapping his hand upon the chair arm:</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-day has ended successfully. But the first
thing I do on coming into office is to bring that
woman to trial.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which woman?” said Mr. Barringcourt, sitting
down on the opposite side of the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That fool who nearly spoilt everything last night
by having too long a tongue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wine surely had had a heating effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Paleaf?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. The one I took rather a fancy to at the
Sebberens’, and asked you to introduce me to.”
And he laughed cynically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh,” said Mr. Barringcourt easily, “you’ll let
that die down. Set a constant guard of two priests
to watch the curtain. Such vigilance will satisfy
the people. Besides, Crokerly is doing the work of
the panelling, and none can do it like him. You
can’t afford to quarrel with him over the mischiefmaking
propensities of a woman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean to say you would look lightly on
her conduct of last night?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“Of course! She did you no harm. It’s herself
she’s harmed, as she’ll find out as time goes on.
It’s always best to be a bit forbearing with women;
they’re given to flying off rather unexpectedly at
times.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No excuse. No excuse at all. She did it from
malicious intention and love of meddling.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you propose to do, then? Tear her
tongue out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Imprison her for life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O Lord!” said Mr. Barringcourt, and he laughed.
Then he laughed again, and again he said, “O Lord!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other frowned, and the light of anger glinted
in his eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You seem to rather approve of her conduct,” he
said. “Certainly I have to thank you for your
speech, though, candidly speaking, neither I, nor I
believe anyone else, could make head or tail of it”
(he spoke in a genuinely puzzled voice), “and for
various other things I have to thank you; but in the
matter of dealing with this woman, I beg you will not
interfere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Mr. Barringcourt, in a low, clear voice,
“I shall interfere. The Serpent is like everything
else. It can’t afford to get too much talked about,
or its reputation’s gone. If you prosecute her, you
make yourself and it the laughing-stock of Lucifram.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I uphold its sacredness and sanctity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cant and tomfoolery! You say I made a speech
last night you didn’t understand—and I didn’t take
the pains to understand it myself. But if you persist
in this, I’ll make another before long which will
appeal to everyone, and tread on no general corns at
all, but that of the individual.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“You are in a quarrelsome mood to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I’ve been in the society of priests all day,
and they weary me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a hint to me. However, for the present
you may have your way, but I tell you candidly, if
there’s any hubbub made, I bring her to trial.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he went away; but walking along the silent
streets he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Barringcourt’s as spoilt as a child. Cross him in
the least thing, and he’s inside out in no time. Yet
in some whimsical, flimsical kind of way he’s been
the best friend I’ve had, and helped on considerably
the present affairs. All the same, that girl shall suffer.
The thing to do in this world is to teach people to
keep their tongues still. It’s three parts the battle
of life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Mr. Barringcourt, left to himself, stood a long
time looking into the rekindled fire, which tells so
much to those who read it properly. And his face
betokened more weariness and contempt than even
in the past years, and the lines of his features were
finer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Revenge first; thanks a very doubtful second,”
he said at length, and then went off to the stables.</p>

<p class='c004'>All through the blackness of the night the black
steeds galloped, and some mistook their dusky forms
for passing clouds, and their wild eyes for distant stars,
and the rhythm of their feet for the rumbling wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>That night, as Rosalie slept, the frog left its
customary place on the washing-stand, and came
close to her ear. And though all the room beyond
was dark, the light round her head and pillow
was very white and pure.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>All the things the frog whispered it would be
unfair to say, for the frog was working for its own
ends, as most of us do, and therefore coloured things
to its own liking.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie woke in the morning, and looked at the
deceitful frog, now sitting on the washing-stand, and
said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been dreaming that a tiny little angel came
and sang to me and laughed. And though I can’t
remember one word of what it said, I know that
everything was very pleasant—so that many a time
I found that I was laughing too.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <span class='large'>A CONFESSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Time flew on till it was just two days before
Christmas, or, at least, the festival which in Lucifram
takes the place of Christmas in our world.</p>

<p class='c004'>On this particular afternoon Rosalie dressed with
the greatest possible care, and looked three consecutive
times sideways in the glass, to see if her
nose was any better disposed to turn downwards;
but it wasn’t. Still, it detracted nothing from the
general effect, and, indeed, might be said to help, if
only on the side of morality, to keep her from growing
conceited.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frog, having come to that stage when one
evidently regards oneself as quite perfect enough,
felt no qualms as to its appearance, took not one
doubtful glance into the glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie, when she was ready, put her head through
the door to tell Miss Crokerly she was going to pay
a call; she did not say where.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Crokerly, busy with festival matters, simply
nodded her head. It was just a little after three.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie left the house, and walked on quickly till
she came to Greensward Avenue. Coming here, her
steps slackened; but she continued walking till she
came in sight of Marble House. Here she came
to a dead stand, and looked blindly on the pavement.
Her heart was beating so quickly that if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>passers-by had not been walking along so heavily
they must have stopped to inquire about it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But from a full stop she ran lightly and hurriedly
up the steps and rang the bell. There was no escape
now, for within thirty seconds it had opened. There
stood Everard, just the same as ever, as silent, as
polite, no more surprised.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie took her courage in both hands. There
was that hideous umbrella stand that a dowager-duchess
had once exclaimed was the most charming
novelty she’d ever seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is Mr. Barringcourt at home?” said she.</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked as if he had never seen her before, but
after a moment’s pause he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Will you come this way?” And led her
through the outer vestibule into the wide and gloomy
hall.</p>

<p class='c004'>There he left her, and went in the direction of the
Master’s study, but soon returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>The afternoon had quite faded now, and as he
conducted her along the western corridor he turned
on the lights.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt received her almost silently. He
made some remark about the weather—it was of
little importance. He drew a chair for her. Rosalie
sat down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I came to see you,” she began, clasping her hands
tightly inside her muff, “because—because—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because,” said he, in the most distant of voices,
“you wished to see Mariana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I’m afraid I was too selfish to think of
Mariana. I was thinking only of myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not notice the alteration in his expression,
because she had not noticed the previous hardness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>his voice. But she got a vague idea he was not
particularly pleased to see her, yet was determined
to go on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has sometimes struck me,” she began hurriedly,
“that it was very ill-mannered of me to run away
from you. I—I—I escaped by a little door in the
stable wall.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A very curious silence followed this remark; then
Rosalie continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The country beyond was very beautiful—at least, I
thought it was. It—it led me to a white house, with a
low verandah and a pretty garden. It took me a whole
day to go, and the sun was setting when I got there.
In the house I met a youth—at least, I thought he
was young; but afterwards he told me he was
nearly as old as you. But he seemed to grow
very quickly in the time that I was staying there.
He took me to his father. At first I thought he was
very old, because his hair was white. I had just one
day’s holiday when I was there, and then I went to
live in a little hut all alone, with a plantation in front
of it. I sowed a basket of seeds in the ground that
the Governor (that is the name I knew him by) had
given me. But first I had to dig in the soil, and I
didn’t like digging at all; I hated it. After that,
everything went by the rule of contrary. The seeds
never came up; they grew underneath, and looked to
me like very beautiful jewels. But they took a great
deal of digging out and freeing from the soil. I took
them to the Governor, and he sent them somewhere,
I think he said it was to the city, to be tested and
valued. But every time they were sent back and
marked as rubbish. I’ve never felt quite the same
since. I used to feel young before, but ever since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>I’ve felt as old as old. And I do nothing but pretend
all day long, in little and big things alike. I pretend
least with you of anyone, and that night I ran away
from you in the street (you remember it?) I felt quite
surprised, and in one way just a little happy. It
made me feel just a little more alive. But after a
while the Governor said I had better come back again
into the world. I didn’t want to, because there was
nowhere to go to, and I did not want to come back
to this house again. I was tired of prisons. But
when he told me to come back into the world I was
obedient, because I knew he was much wiser than
anyone that I had ever met before. He was kind to
me in some ways, although he never threw kindness
away. So one morning I started on the return
journey, and Brightcoat came along with me for
company.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When we were in the streets, I went along scarcely
knowing what I was doing, I was so tired, and at
last I sat down on a doorstep. It was Sir John
Crokerly’s, and when his sister came home she took
me in; and I have lived there ever since. There is
nothing else to tell you. Now you know all, you
need trouble yourself to be agreeable to me no longer.
After all, I owed it to you to tell you. You gave me
a greater gift than I thought it possible anyone on
earth could ever give me. And you no doubt put it
down to science, but I put it down to God. And—and
about my coming here, when first I did come to
you. I came from the sacred place of the temple.
I had given up wishing to be cured of being dumb—at
least, praying to be cured, because I thought God
was not wishful to cure me. And I prayed to the
Serpent just to help me to live the right way, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>I knew that that was the only thing God really cared
about And the Serpent seemed quite to disappear;
in its place came the presence of God. Only one
little ball of light and gold was left out of all that
giant frame and jewelled head. And I don’t know
quite how it was I came to you, any more than now I
have gone to Miss Crokerly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With these words said, she got up and stood facing
him, for he had not sat down during this monologue
but stood looking at her, a thing which, after first
beginning, she seemed quite unconscious of.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her words had been simple, her sentences short
and abrupt, and at times somewhat disconnected,
but Rosalie’s voice was so sweet that it seemed to
run like a silver bell in and out the mazes of this
experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now she held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have detained you long enough. Perhaps you’ll
forgive the school-girl style. Though I feel so old, I
can find no other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come with me to the stable,” said he, “and show
me the door. I don’t believe there is one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will be able to find it yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had much rather you came with me. It is the
only way in which I can credit your story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So together they went through the silent house
and silent grounds and silent shrubbery. The red
light shone full down the middle pathway to the
stable door. But Brightcoat shed a softer brilliancy
round about, if not so clearly and direct. But then
there was no need for it as guide to-day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stables shone out with a certain curious light
of their own—a dusky, shadowy brightness.</p>

<p class='c004'>At a certain touch the unseen door slipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>backward, and revealed the shadowy twilight
within.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as is customary with horses, they turned their
graceful heads and looked with wild eyes on the newcomers,
and one in the far corner neighed. But they
seemed shadowy. All were shadowy. Eyes shone
like carbuncles, the only distinctive feature. And
there was nothing of warmth there. Everything was
cold and chilly as a vault</p>

<p class='c004'>But Brightcoat’s light was useful here. It shone
in direct rays on to that little unnoticed door that
was built so unobtrusively in the wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There,” said Rosalie, and she touched his arm.
“I went through there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strange,” said he. “I never saw that door
before. How did you open it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With the key of my uncle’s safe. But that has
gone. I don’t know what I did with it. I was in
such a hurry to get through and close it after
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the path led you to a low white house with
a verandah?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Let us return. It is cold here. You’ll
give your horses rheumatism if you keep them in so
damp a place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not acclimatised. But we will go.
Strange I never noticed that door. As for the
others, I suppose if they did notice it, they
imagined I had done so too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they were back again in the house, which
seemed cheerful after the intense cold without, Mr.
Barringcourt said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you have tea before you go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, thank you. Our last tea together had not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>very pleasant ending, though it began so charmingly.
We’re like most people—best friends when parted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I may not see you again till Festival night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you still renew the invitation?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I were not very contrary, you would make me
angry. You harp so constantly upon an unreasoning
subject.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah!” said she suddenly. “Let me see Mariana.
Send for her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not to-night”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, to-night. I will not keep her longer than a
minute. Just to see if she is just the same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She has not altered. Take my word for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You said if I came here I should see her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must have misunderstood me. I never said
so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—I don’t believe you ever mean me to see
Mariana again,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed? What makes you think so?” and he
laughed again, not at all kindly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because you know quite well that I should do my
very best to persuade her to come away with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie bowed, and swept away toward the door,
and when she got there she said to Everard, quite
loud enough for Mr. Barringcourt to hear, who still
stood in the hall:</p>

<p class='c004'>“When next you see Mariana, please give her my
love, and tell her I asked to see her, but was not
successful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He bowed solemnly and let her pass, but took no
further notice than if he had been made of stone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <span class='large'>FESTIVAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Now came Christmas night. On Lucifram Christmas
Day wasn’t marred by any subsequent church-going.
It was nothing better than a heathen feast; the Serpent
had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p class='c004'>On that day the children went simply wild, and
gave themselves incredible airs; demanded their best
toys, gorged oranges and apples, made themselves ill
with plum-pudding, demanded their full share of
turkey, and got it, and looked with expectant eyes on
the iced cake when it appeared. Just as if they’d
been starving all day! The little wretches!</p>

<p class='c004'>The grown-up world, unless it was going out to
an evening party, yawned, and ate its customary
Christmas fare, and drank it too. Then the old
people played cards, and the young people sang,
especially the young men with untrained voices, and
the lovers behaved as if they really were in love with
one another.</p>

<p class='c004'>Come and watch Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now that day there had arrived two Christmas
presents so beautiful that many an empress might
have envied them. The first came early in the
morning, before the postman; a curious and unusual
thing. There is no doubt Santa Claus was on the
war-path, for such a lovely ball and reception dress
could only have been made in some magic fairyland.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>It was like shining silken <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêpe</span></i>, all frosted over with
tiny sparkling jewels, all in white. It shone like soft
pure snow in the sunlight, and fell in folds of simplest
grace. It was so very simply, yet so very wonderfully
made, that one wondered what it was that gave
it such a beautiful effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it not too dead white to suit me?” said she to
Brightcoat, after going into raptures on its beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See here, there is a little box below,” said it.</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie opened it, and uttered the most real
cry of delight in her life.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s my stone, my first stone, that I loved so, all
set in gold and ready to wear. Oh, Brightcoat,
Brightcoat, look!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And she sat down on the bed and hid her face
in the pillows, and cried from different emotions.
At last she wiped away the tears and looked up,
her eyes falling on the shining stone again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love them all as if they were my children, and
that somehow the most, because it was the first. And
I believe it loves me too. Look how beautiful a ray
of light it sends towards me! And I never hoped to
see it again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie took it up, and kissed it, and shed tears
upon it, but the light from it was never dimmed;
one might have thought it was made tear-proof.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I need no other colour. This is quite enough.
And you, Brightcoat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; of course, there’s me,” said the other
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the beginning of the day. But when the
postman came, besides bringing letters and cards
without end, some of the latter bearing halfpenny
stamps after the style of circulars, he brought a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>parcel, also directed to Rosalie, in handwriting that the
frog declared was superior to anything it had ever
seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was opened in public, and inside was a pair of
slippers as white as snow, and worked in diamonds.
And they were such a curious shape they looked as
if they must really be antique, because they had
little square toes, and gold straps across. They
reminded one of the daintiest garden clogs, so light
were they, and when Rosalie put them on she wanted
to dance right away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re made on the same pattern as the little
wooden clog I have upstairs,” cried she. “Look,
Miss Crokerly, they dance of themselves,” and in
excess of spirits she pirouetted round the room, and
kissed both those elderly people from superabundance
of excessively childish glee.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where they had come from she didn’t know. She
thought they had come from the same source as the
first, although they came by post. So that evening
she dressed for the real pleasure of the thing. And
when it came to pinning the jewel into the bosom of
her dress, her hands trembled just because she loved
it so. It shed just the same soft shades on to her
dress as the light of the moon might shed on to the
snow—a passing green and golden and palest blue
that melted into white. And on her shoulder the
ever—present frog, and a new light in her eyes, because
the ice-tears had rolled out of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>And underneath the shining jewel her heart beat
quickly. She went with Sir John, Miss Crokerly
having preceded them in Mr. Barringcourt’s carriage
some time ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know,” said she, “I thought at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>last minute you’d change your mind and stay
away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no,” he replied. “I always go when
Barringcourt throws his house open. There are so
many things that interest me there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. It’s quite after the nature of a museum, is
it not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. Unlabelled. So that it has an additional
charm.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They took their turn in the long line of carriages,
and after a considerable time were enabled to alight.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was an awning from the parapet to the door,
and the steps were also covered a deep red.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked for Everard. He was not there.
Two powdered footmen instead. They were not
inmates of the Marble House. Neither were any of
those who personally waited upon the guests that
night. There was not a waiting-maid anywhere
about to compare with Mariana, and Rosalie could
not have imagined her proud and delicate face
amongst that throng. But how different did the
wide hall look that night! Brilliantly lit, and with
huge fires burning at either end. Fires fit for Festival
and freezing weather. And no undue crowding of
guests to do away with comfort and beauty and enjoyment.
The wide doors to the southern wing, leading
to the picture-gallery and conservatory, were thrown
open. So also were those to the west, containing the
reception rooms—no empty, echoing fireless places
now, but full of life and laughter and vivacity.</p>

<p class='c004'>A reception was held first; dancing did not begin
till eleven, when a well-known princess was to lead
with a gavotte. She was very proud of her instep.</p>

<p class='c004'>At twelve supper was to be served in the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>subterranean hall, a place Rosalie had never been in,
nor, indeed, anyone else. And after that dancing
began again, and continued till four. Then carriages
and home.</p>

<p class='c004'>On entering, Rosalie was presented with a programme
that explained all this. It was book-shaped,
with a mother-of-pearl back, and in the centre a
perfect little garden clog with a broken string in
gold, and underneath “Christmas 0039”—that being
the year as reckoned in Lucifram.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, how charming!” cried one lady, who had
just received hers before Rosalie. “An old clog
for luck! It is delightful!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Flowers the most gorgeous and tasteful banked
every available corner; truly, the house had been
completely altered from darkness into light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt on these occasions made an
excellent host. He had none of the clumsiness of
the bachelor host, being for all the world as much
at home as if he’d been married and had ten
children. Now, it was a dancing night, and thanks
to an excellent example, there was not one smoke-absorbed,
or card-absorbed, or billiard-absorbed man
present. For one night everybody made a delightful
martyr of themselves, and secretly enjoyed the process.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s programme did not fill so quickly, for
there were many there who took her to have
religious mania, and doubted they might have
something to put up with. Moreover, there were
very few persons there that she really knew. At
last she was suddenly accosted by Mr. Barringcourt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first and last dance, Rosalie,” said he, and
they looked at one another. Then looking down at
her programme, he said: “What an empty list!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“It’s quite right, thank you. I don’t care about
dancing. I’d rather watch other people, and listen
to the music. Find me some quiet old lady whom
I may sit by, and who does not talk too much. It
is all I ask of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are not many present. They are all young
and frivolous, or old and giddy. A much easier task
would be to find you partners for every dance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should be dead tired before supper-time; I
can’t talk to strangers, and I don’t know every
dance. And it takes rather a brave man to accost
me; I perceive them mentally screwing themselves
up to the pitch as they approach.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Under those circumstances, it was very kind of
you to come. Here comes the Princess. I’ll return
later.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Princess smiled so condescendingly all round
that everyone was charmed with her. She had a
light walk, as one who treads on eggs and fears to
break them, and her admirers said she glided as the
spirits do.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as she came—and, of course, she came
rather late—the proceedings of the evening began.
She danced the gavotte, and brought her own
dancing-master and fiddler to play, as she was
accustomed to be played up to.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the real dancing began there was one of
the best bands in Lucifram in readiness, that all
the evening more or less had been playing favourite
airs, and another to relieve them when occasion
needed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt sought and found Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Should you not have given the first dance to the
Princess?” said she.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“No. My step does not suit her, and she is
sufficiently truthful to tell me of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can scarcely believe <em>your</em> step is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No? She is easier to deal with than you. She
goes greatly on credit. It’s a royal failing. Come,
let us begin; if this waltz is as it should be, it will be
all too short.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And no seventh heaven could have surpassed, if
equalled it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How lovely,” said she suddenly, “if one could die
dancing!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would mean company on a lonely road,” said
he. “And cheat death of some of its tragedy, with
well-matched partners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you—did you send me those slippers that I’m
wearing?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The little clog on the back of my programme.
It’s the exact fac-simile of one I used to wear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had a little story as near as possible to that of
Ally Krimjo. For one morning there was found in
the middle of my hall a little garden clog without
owner or companion. It came there through barred
doors and spring-barred doors, and none could make
out how it came there. Not even I. I never learnt
it till the night when you came to say your lesson.
I proved it when you wore these little satin-covered
skates to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll give it back to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! I’m keeping it for luck. That is a lovely
stone you’re wearing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s one I told you of. Dug from the garden with
a great big fork and spade, just as a man digs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe I’ve seen it before in my father’s house.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“No, indeed. Unless your father was the Governor
I spoke of.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then at last the dance was over.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve found the lady you asked me for,” said he.
“Miss Crokerly is my guardian angel to-night. It is
she who discovered her. Here is an excellent place
where you may sit and see everything, and hear the
music to advantage too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then he took her to a seat, and introduced her
to a lady sitting there. She was so charming a
companion. Her silences were never awkward, and
now and again she would give Rosalie information
about certain people, all of a good-natured if shrewd
kind, that was the highest entertainment.</p>

<p class='c004'>At twelve punctually the company descended to
supper.</p>

<p class='c004'>The staircase down was of black marble, and spiral
also, like the one above. It had none of the slippery
treachery that characterised its sister staircase, though,
and it seemed altogether of a much more reliable
make. To a spectator the gay colours of the ladies
and their sparkling jewels looked like brilliant
multicoloured scales on a gigantic serpent, reared
pillar-wise to support the vast chamber below.</p>

<p class='c004'>The subterranean banquet hall of Marble House
was nothing better, nothing worse than a crypt.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had great and massive pillars of hardened,
blackened marble; a fitting support for a fitting
house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Its floors were tiled in marble. Its walls of
marble too. But whereas a crypt, if lit at all, is
content with lamps of oil, or the feeble glimmer of
electricity, this place was deluged with light. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>most brilliant candelabra hung from the ceilings,
sparkling in the thousand glintings of diamond glass.
The tables were covered with finest snow-white cloths,
and all the decorations were of silver, purest and
brightest and most finely worked. And all the flowers
were red.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here, screened from view, the band was playing
gently. A soft and scented air of luxury arose, as
if to show that crypts upon occasion have finer
possibilities than dining-rooms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Princess, led by Mr. Barringcourt, descended
first, and half way down stopped to admire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which was the pirate, you or Mr. Todbrook?”
said she. “I’m sure you carted off the plan of a
cathedral, and the material too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is an open secret,” replied he, laughing.
“But his was the theft, not mine. I simply inherited
what he had left. But he had gloomy taste. Now,
were I building, I’d fix upon a little bungalow, a
whitewashed place, with a world-wide garden for the
summer-time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Princess was not of that simple nature that
enjoys simplicity, but she delighted in anything odd,
as she considered it, because it made her laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you really mean to say you are philosopher
enough to grow accustomed to things?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Till I see a way of escape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you see none from here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Princess had not such keen eyes as Rosalie;
she was not fond of studying faces, except for what
animal beauty they might possess.</p>

<p class='c004'>“None,” said he. “Although ’tis said Todbrook
escaped by the back door.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He died,” said she, and looked at him with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>vague suspicion of horror in her eyes. She was of a
superstitious nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>But he laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You talk of death at a dance?” said he. “One
might almost think, Princess, you were primitive,
and scorned the guarded terms of civilisation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The conversation had taken a turn not to her
fancy. He had thrown a shadow over the brilliantly-lit
supper-room. She shivered involuntarily, and
looked about her petulantly, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you quite sure this place isn’t damp?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all! Not a rheumatic dampness, anyway.
Spirits do not count; they are above it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then their conversation ran into a lighter channel
suited to the occasion, and the feast began right
royally, when the plumed peacock was carried in, to
be admired in death, a lasting tribute to its vanity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The band played, and the people laughed and
feasted and talked. In the whole of Lucifram that
night could not have been found a gayer or more
brilliant company.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <span class='large'>MYSTERIES IN MARBLE HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>But there was one person who never came down to
supper—at the right time, anyway—and that was
Rosalie. She had strolled off alone to the picture-gallery,
led to look again on that curious representation
of the former master of Marble House.</p>

<p class='c004'>The silence as the last guest went down below
made her heart beat a little faster. She listened to
the last echoing laugh, and he seemed listening too.
The slightly bending figure indeed betokened an
attitude of close attention—almost the hidden smile
of one who, listening, understands.</p>

<p class='c004'>The long line of pictures ran either side of her,
each in itself a work of beauty. She remembered
that day when Mariana had gone off to the east
wing from here.</p>

<p class='c004'>To-night the east wing was closed. All this great
glare of artificial light never traversed there. A
heavy crimson curtain hid the polished door that
led to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Rosalie’s spirit wandered off in that direction.
A great curiosity, with a deeper feeling underneath
to give the strength it needed, led her out into the
central hall—led her gliding towards that gloomy
fatal door.</p>

<p class='c004'>She drew the curtain back with one white hand,
white as snow against this deeper shade, and turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the handle. The door opened. Blackness, dampness,
and the smell of decay and mildew met her, like a
blast of foul despair.</p>

<p class='c004'>She threw up her head, passed through, and the
door slipped to behind her. And for one moment
it seemed as if the parting kiss of freedom glowed
on her forehead once again. And yet again the
darkness was dispersed, for both the frog and jewel,
and her own shining dress, that shone apparently
without the aid of outer light, gave all the light it
needed.</p>

<p class='c004'>And here, within this gloomy place, at last came
life and beauty, and the soft, tender light that lived
in its own strength and was unborrowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>No. 13! How well Rosalie remembered it!
Mariana’s workroom, a worse place than many a
prisoner’s cell. Yet it had about it an air of indefinable
grandeur, the place of no petty criminal, or
one sunk in moral disease. The rusty latch uplifted
and disclosed the low-built room beyond, and the
dim burner, the oaken chests, the damp, peeled walls,
the shadowy corners, the tragedy of silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>But what of these? They served but as backgrounds
to a picture, and fitting backgrounds.
For there, beside the long, low table, hid by the
sheet, as white to-day as ever it had been three years
ago, sat Mariana. But nothing there equalled the
marble whiteness of her face. Her graceful figure
bent forward, her hands were clasped on the table,
and on her lips was that curious smile of pain, quite
frozen there, as, wide open, her eyes stared at this
hidden treasure on the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some spider, mistaking the silent figure for a thing
inanimate, had weaved a web of finest threads from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>head to foot, covering her silken hair and rough-spun
dress. But respecting the icy chill that hung about
those cold-cut features and hands, it had left them
free and bare.</p>

<p class='c004'>All about the cell fluttered the silent moths,
settling and rising from the table. Yet they were
powerless to canker anything. The bitter iron of
living sorrow had too hard a crust.</p>

<p class='c004'>The light that Rosalie brought with her lit up the
room. She stood upon the threshold, gazing spellbound
with horror on the central form. Could this
be Mariana—this frozen statue, this figure nipped to
the spirit with unavailing pain? Oh, never, never!
For there this beautiful machine, working so fine a
marvel of creation, had come upon a horrid pause, a
fearful counterfeit of death, a fearful mockery of life!</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the spell broke. With outstretched arms she
hurried forward. “Mariana!”</p>

<p class='c004'>No sound or movement came in reply. She placed
her hand upon the stiffened shoulder. The cobweb
broke; the spider saw, and ran away. She threw her
arms around the other’s neck, and kissed her stony
cheek. No sound or movement in reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Burning tears fell from her eyes. They had no
power to melt that which had been congealed so
long, frozen from ice to marble.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing availed—even when she fell upon her
knees, and pressed her warm lips a hundred times
upon the death-chilled fingers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Powerless and weak! O God! for strength,
strength, strength of some sort, to give life to the
dying or the dead! What blasphemy! what heresy!
what presumption!—the ignorant tumult of a still
untutored heart. Then she drew back and looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>at Mariana, fighting down every emotion to make
way for thought. Her eyes fired with indignant
protest, and she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d rather be a murderer out and out and hanged
for it! And to think of this night, when in this very
house there is no sound of anything but gaiety and
laughter; and people feasting! And here there sits
a prisoner and worse, and one man conscious of it.
Oh, Brightcoat! How can you think well of such as
he! I cannot bear to look at him again.” And then
she stooped and took the slippers off she wore.
“I wore them happily at first, but now they’re
all so tight they pinch my feet I wonder what
sweating or freezing system it was brought them
into shape? And I so selfish as never to insist
before on seeing whether she were free or no.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The slippers off, she looked at them, then at the
silent figure sitting there, and turned away, half-shivering.
She placed the slippers upon the table
on the sheet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The moths descending, fluttered round them, yet
did not touch; for, taught by instinct, they had
learnt what could and what could not return to
dust.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then with one parting call of “Mariana!” one
loving kiss, one shivering glance around the dismal
place, she went away, closing the door behind her,
into the outer passage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Curiosity bade her try some of those other low and
numbered doors; but all were locked. This tragic
wing was surely haunted. The air was condensed
of sighs—an essence which hung heavy on the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>But before opening that crystal door, all rusted
iron and cobwebs from this inner side, Rosalie stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>still to think. Then she pushed it open, and
emerged into the brilliant hall, still silent. From
here she passed toward the staircase leading down
to the supper-room, where all the guests were now
assembled.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to return to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no lack of merriment throughout the
length of tables. But as the supper progressed, and
people became accustomed to their surroundings,
general comments were made upon a long and
double-folded curtain of heavy material that hung
from floor to ceiling at the lower end of the vast
chamber beside the staircase.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was present at that supper a young girl just
out that season—as giddy, as merry, and full of
happy spirits as one unknown to care or saddened
thoughts can ever be.</p>

<p class='c004'>And to close a spirited discussion with some as
young and thoughtless as herself, just as the feast
was ending, she left her place amidst a laughing
silence, and ran to the farther upper end of the
table, where Mr. Barringcourt sat beside the Princess.
With the happy assurance of youth never rebuffed,
she accosted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I come,” said she, still laughing, “to plead on the
side of our religion. They say that dismal curtain
bears a resemblance, and a very striking one, to the
crimson one within the temple. Will you not
contradict them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked across the room toward it “One’s
black and the other’s red,” he said, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; but we were discussing what might be
beyond,” and her face was demure, though her eyes
were sparkling with merriment.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“With what result?” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We all grew curious. Princess, will you be
curious, too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, instantly. What is beyond that curtain, Mr.
Barringcourt? Tell us, or show us, pray.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The silence of expectation had settled on the
guests. Barringcourt leaned forward toward the
table, playing with the half-filled glass of wine
beside him. And when he spoke his voice was
low, yet perfectly distinct.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know,” said he, “it was a foible of Mr.
Todbrook’s to collect as many heathen gods and
false ones as lay in his power. This house was
built on a system—I might say systems—of
idolatry; its furniture collected from disused
temples sought for all over the face of Lucifram.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Behind that curtain stands a god, more hideous
than any I have ever seen, and I’ve seen plenty in my
time, as maybe most of you have done. The curtain
came along with it from the temple where it stood,
and in a state of wonderful preservation. Over one
thousand years in age.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is beyond?” was the general question
throughout the chamber.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A death’s-head of unusual size, worshipped and
feared of all in the parts from where it came.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let us see it.” A general murmur of anticipation
ran round the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These poor heathens!” said one lady, and her
tone was patronising. “How ignorant they must
have been.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And are still in some parts, madam,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We do our best with the missionaries,” she
replied.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“Let us see it, please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the voice of the charming youthful
pioneer from the back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a death’s-head,” said he, and he smiled very
kindly as he spoke. “They are not beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I’ve enjoyed myself so much all evening, Mr.
Barringcourt, that I could not bear to be disappointed
now. Besides, the Princess has commanded you.
Please show us the head.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has never to be seen but in complete darkness.
It’s a clause of the will. It was the condition on
which he bought it, I believe, from a few crazy priests,
who had no congregation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But they all wished to see it, light or no light. It
was a little novelty to wind up supper and take the
place of toasts.</p>

<p class='c004'>So suddenly the light switched out, and left the
place in total darkness. Those who were on terms
familiar enough clasped one another’s hands. They
found the situation not unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then upon the instant the black curtain swung
backwards and revealed a space beyond, from which
gleamed out, in ashen whiteness and dusky hollows
from the blackness, the skeleton head of death. It
was the head of some great giant of unusual size,
with yellow teeth discoloured, but all present. All
looked at it with gloomy interest, and some began
to wish, as darkness continued, they’d been less eager
to examine it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But suddenly and swiftly in the silence two
gleaming balls of light glared red from the empty
sockets, to turn their gaze at every individual round
the room, and with a gleam most sinister. This was
truly horrible. A room so black and dark that none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>could see each other. The bleached skull and skeleton
of a superhuman head. And above all the terrible
gleaming eyes, the only flash of light in the whole
room, that had the power of penetrating, and gave
each the impression the evil eye was fixed on him
alone. A spell of silence had fallen. No woman
cried; the laughter of ten minutes since had died;
even the very sound of breathing was now quite
hushed. This was the deadened, powerless load of
nightmare.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly a light appeared on the spiral staircase.
The gleam of snowy whiteness, the soft glow of an
undying lamp, and the pure colours of a splendid
moonshine. And above all a face and figure of most
simple beauty, eyes pure and starlit in contrast to
the red gleam. And a crown of mermaid flaxen
hair, and expression sweet and thoughtful! It was a
wonderful and sweet relief to the ghastly spectacle
below.</p>

<p class='c004'>And on a sudden the full lights flashed on again,
and a sigh of relief burst from every heart and many
lips. The black curtain had fallen. Rosalie alone
remained of the weird scene, descending the spiral
staircase. A little thing will often bring about
reaction, and from being shunned by many, she
from this opportune arrival gained a fair share of
popularity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where have you been?” a dozen voices cried,
glad to make sound again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trying to find a partner,” cried she, and laughed;
and others laughed as well, the search had been so
long and unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Supper is finished.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no lack of those to offer attention now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>and along with this came the general bustle of those
leaving the supper-table.</p>

<p class='c004'>But by the side of Mr. Barringcourt stood the girl
who, from a mixture of youthful spirits and curiosity,
had asked the first the curtain might be moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad I had finished my supper,” said she,
with an attempt at laughing still. “I’m sure I could
never eat anything in here again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is fortunate refreshments are served upstairs,”
he answered. “You would not let so small a thing
interfere with your evening’s pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Reassured somewhat by his tone, she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“After all, it was only an idol, was it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s all. They must be very brave folk to
worship it, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. The Serpent is much less gruesome.
Isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “Well, an empty skull often looks
much worse than it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” said she, “it wasn’t empty. I never saw
such eyes. Never! Never!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You haven’t seen the Serpent yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; but mother did, and she said nothing about
its eyes. She said it was plain to be seen we
worshipped the true god, his scales were such a
lovely gold. I am going to ask Miss Crokerly to
introduce me to her friend. I’m sure if she had not
come then I should have fainted right away. And I
always laughed at Blanche for fainting. She used
to do it so conveniently.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So saying, she slipped away, and to the upper
regions, where, so far as she knew, there was nothing
gruesome hidden away.</p>

<p class='c004'>And soon the episode of the death’s-head was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>forgotten, and the evening’s enjoyment began again
with even greater zest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s programme filled, but she never danced.
Who could, when wearing only stockings? But she
did not go home, but waited for that final dance, and
no one noticed her slipperless feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have not the slightest inclination to dance, Mr.
Barringcourt. I’ve spent one of the most delightfully
lazy evenings I ever spent in my life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I envy you. I’ve been going through a species
of treadmill. I’ve danced with every school-girl in
the room.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Myself included. You began the evening badly,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat down beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where were you all the supper-time?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked at him. She detected the old,
tired, wearily contemptuous expression on his face.
She herself was far from tired. Her eyes were bright.
Her cheeks had flushed a pretty pink; she had been
under no unwilling exertion to please anyone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I stayed upstairs to see how long I’d be forgotten,
and when no one remembered me, and I grew
hungry, I came down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should have acted the part of the jealous
fairy godmother, and blasted us all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, though I be a school-girl, yet I’ve none
of the attractions of youth, and so I’ve learnt
toleration.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s hardly fair to keep repeating what I once said
at random.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Was it at random? I set a whole night apart to
weep about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You had nothing better to do, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The most miserable of all states, you must
acknowledge. And through no fault of my own.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whose, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yours. You have much to be answerable for,
Mr. Barringcourt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “I have expiated most of my
offences to-night; I have danced the polka.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With Miss Sebberen. I saw you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let us go into some quieter room. This dancing
wearies me. I never was fond of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s trailing dress hid her feet, and they passed
into the picture-gallery. It was deserted.</p>

<p class='c004'>She sat down under the picture of Geoffrey
Todbrook.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One day Mariana brought me here and showed
me this picture. I forget what was said, but somewhere
in our conversation she laughed. She said
laughing always produced a pain at her heart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana laughed? You utterly astonish me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His face betrayed no signs of conviction of cruelty,
certainly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Rosalie. “It is astonishing, truly.
Had I lived here as long as she, laughing would have
been utterly beyond me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a good thing you escaped, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t grudge me my freedom?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I grudge no man anything if he wins it, or woman
either. And far from grudging you your freedom,
I’m glad you won it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were glad, then, when I ran away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, no—not at the time. I do not know that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>ever became thoroughly reconciled to you till you
came to see me the other night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here a pause followed, broken only by distant
strains of music.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have another dance on New Year’s Eve,
Mr. Barringcourt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. You will come? It is the one night in the
whole year worth dancing on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would come gladly; but I can find no dress to
my liking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have a week before you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She clasped her hands round her knee, shook her
head and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t come unless I can wear exactly what I
want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what is that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The dress that Mariana was making long ago.
But I expect she’s finished it, and the moths have
eaten it away. But all the same, I won’t come unless
I have it. It is the one thing on earth I’ve set my
heart upon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt looked at her. The pretty air of
reasonless determination suited her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s impossible,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The moths have eaten it away, then,” and without
pretence or acting two big tears rose in her eyes
and fell—one for sorrow at his hardness, one for the
memory of Mariana in the cell.</p>

<p class='c004'>But two tears upon occasion can be very fascinating.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You never did reason, did you, Rosalie?” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. It’s the one thing I’ve done all my life.
But the simpler you are in this world the more you’re
derided. Let me see Mariana to ask her about the
dress?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>“Oh, hang Mariana!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you speaking broadly?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should never use abusive language towards
the individual. I learnt that long ago. If you want
to be profane you should generalise.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whose lax teaching was that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I learnt it from the Governor; the gentleman
whom I met when I ran away from you. But he
wasn’t lax, I’m sure. Perhaps I misunderstood him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wouldn’t put it beyond you. But give me a
form of forcible language that would fit in with his
exposition.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, the only one that presents itself at all to
me is ‘Damn it.’ You see ‘it’ means nothing in
particular, is quite impersonal, and therefore no one
is any the worse for it, yourself included.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re an advocate of that particular form?” said
he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d allow it to you upon occasion, but not to
myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed! Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because if I were a perfect woman I’d never have
any inclination to go further than the ‘d.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re striving after the perfect woman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” sighed Rosalie; “but she’s very delusive.
It’s so easy to overstep the bounds and become
saintly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “I don’t think you’ll ever be that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The strain would be too great. You’d best
remain as you are. I believe the dance is ending.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And—and never a word settled about my dress.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you so much in earnest about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>“Indeed, yes. I went through all the pains and
penalties of trying it on, stood three weary hours as
model, and it was so beautiful my heart longed for it
then, and has done so ever since.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s nothing but imagination. You must look for
something else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They rose together, and suddenly she put her hand
upon his arm, and said in just such a voice as a
mermaid might, half laughing, half plaintively:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t come to dance the New Year in; I’ve
nothing fit to come in. And as for the slippers that
you sent to me, you can search for them just where
you like. I don’t want them, and I won’t wear them.
I only want the dress.” And she showed him her
foot in its silk stocking, without slipper or other
covering.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are your slippers?” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve hidden them, and you may find them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And suddenly he looked at her quite sternly, and
he said: “You’ve been to see Mariana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie returned the glance as meekly as became
the situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The doors were all unlocked. Besides, you
should have found me a partner for the supper-time.
I resented it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what do you think of Mariana?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think that you and I are inexpressibly different
in our idea of things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed! It is because of you she’s placed where
she is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And because of me you ought to place her where
she isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not disposed to laugh. Your constant
prying is objectionable.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“I pay dearly for it: hard words and cold glances
from everyone, yourself included.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not too high a price, it seems.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dear me, no! I trust to the luck that saved Red
Chin’s wife. I’m not in the least bit inclined to cry
to-night, Mr. Barringcourt I feel happy enough to
dance without slippers on.” And she stooped and
kissed the precious stone she wore.</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at it and then at her. “Give that stone
to me,” he said suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her cheeks paled as quickly. “I love it too well
to ever think of parting with it,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The price of Mariana’s freedom.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” and her voice was a mixture of a gasp and
weakness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And yet you love Mariana! How you do
misjudge the word! You don’t know what love is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither do you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I make no professions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have no right to give away this stone; it was
given to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep it, then. I simply asked for it to prove
your inherent selfishness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You could have proved it by a much simpler
test. It is one of the dragon’s heads impossible
to conquer. Every now and then I give it a sleeping
potion, and get some rest. It’s very efficacious, I can
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned and went away, and they did not see
each other again that night, or rather morning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE WORTH OF A JEWEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The next morning, rather earlier than usual, Mr.
Barringcourt called to see Miss Crokerly. He saw
her alone; but as he was crossing the hall on going
away, he was stopped by hearing Rosalie’s voice from
the staircase, and by seeing her coming toward him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have been waiting for you,” said she, raising her
finger as if in warning as she came nearer, and
speaking very softly. “The dragon is sleeping,
completely under the influence of a powerful drug.
In the interim I’ve brought you this. The thing you
asked for last night.” And she held toward him a
tiny jewel-case.</p>

<p class='c004'>He took it slowly, looking at her, and then at it.
Then the contents dawned upon him, and he looked
at her again and laughed, though his eyes had a
piercing keenness in them that took away the effect
of the laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then her manner changed, and she too laughed.
She raised her lips to his ear and whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I drugged the dragon with <em>Reason</em>, think what
you will,” and still laughing, would have moved away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now it just chanced (for those who find no excuse
for what followed) that there hung just above them
a bunch of misletoe. Miss Crokerly was a great
advocate of Christmas parties for children, had had
three such since December began, and holly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>other Christmas decorations were much in evidence.
But neither person concerned was at the moment
cognisant of this fact. One was looking down, and
one was looking up, but not at the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>But all the same, in opposition to the laws of
etiquette, yet quite in accordance with those of nature,
Mr. Barringcourt suddenly stooped and took her
hands and kissed her. It wasn’t a bit like the
ordinary kiss a man would give a woman. It fell as
softly on her lips as a breath of snow—nothing of
fire—so that she laughed again, and shook her hands
free, and saying “Thank you,” ran away again.</p>

<p class='c004'>After that Mr. Barringcourt went away, looking as
thoughtful and preoccupied as if he had never been
frivolous in his life.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went home, and passed at once to his own
private laboratory and study. He took with him the
tiny jewel-case, and going up to one of the big
windows facing the front of the house, took out the
stone and looked at it. He looked at it so long
that a bystander would have grown impatient.
Then he went to the other side of the room,
and opened what seemed to be a cupboard,
but was really a set of shutters opening upon a
window looking on the garden at the back. The
light from this window showed the jewel differently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before it had been softest green and pink; now
a constant red ray gleamed from the centre. He
noted it, and turned it many ways. The light still
remained—no passing brilliancy or change of colour.
Then he went into the inner room, and noted the
different blendings and the texture by placing it
beneath a glass, there to examine it minutely.
Finally he poured out from an old flagon, worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>and chased in a substance like polished silver, a
liquid that flamed up in the crucible like white-flamed
fire, intense and beautiful. And into this he threw a
stone that matched in some respects the one he
carried in his hand. Under this great strength of
heat it disappeared; no tiny fragment of lustre or of
substance now remained. And quite remorseless to
its fate, he next flung in the stone that Rosalie had
given him, and bent forward eagerly to notice the
effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>No change! A glimmering blend of colour on the
surface of the flame. Then with his fingers, as if the
leaping tongues had been but water, he took the
jewel out, and dashed the sprays of fire away like
drops of water.</p>

<p class='c004'>A smile, incredulous and all surprised, at first
played on his lips and in his eyes as he looked at
the jewel. Then after some deep thought, he started
as one from a dream, the light of sudden understanding
in his eyes. He placed the stone once
more within its case, and put it in an inner pocket,
then left the room and locked the door again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaving the wing, he went out into the central hall,
and passed across it to the eastern side, with its
brilliant door and exterior brightness, all so false to
the sordid truth behind. But there he paused, and
called across the high, empty, echoing space:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everard, what is Mariana’s number? I forget.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thirteen.” The answer was simple and distinct.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a lucky number, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe it’s a significant one. Unlucky, some
say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We go by the rule of contrary. I think myself
it must be lucky.” And he laughed and flung open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the great doors and passed inside. They swung to
after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then at the door he sought for he stopped, and
with the same quick movement threw it open.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inside, the miserable cell, the scanty furniture, the
covered table, the cobwebs, the thick dust, the cloud
of hovering moths, the stiff and rigid figure; but
to his eyes on entering, not the central figure of
attraction. For there upon the table, standing
daintily upon the covering cloth, he saw the little
satin clogs, with their golden strings and skate-like
edges, that turned up daintily, bearing an almost
laughable resemblance to someone’s pretty nose.
For in the same way that many persons’ clothes on
wearing them become a part of them and look like
them, so these, scarce worn, became and looked a
part of Rosalie. And in the midst of all this mildew,
and decay, and icy lifelessness, they stood a thing of
life—an open protest against everything surrounding
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Without looking toward Mariana, he went and took
them in his hand. They were not soiled. They had
only danced one short delightful dance, and stood
demurely side by side, longing to start again. The
moths had never touched them; they were invulnerable.
Then placing them once more upon the sheet,
he leaned his hand upon the table and looked at
Mariana.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither pity, distress, cruelty, nor any other emotion
played on his face. He stood and looked at her, as
deep in thought as if his mind was occupied with
pages of a book, a long, long time. Then throwing
back the covering from the table, he revealed the
thick piles of satin that she had worked at in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>three years passed long since. So this was the dress
that Rosalie coveted; well, it was worth asking for,
or would be when finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the first time on Lucifram, and here in one of
its most dismal cells, a smile free from artifice, from
cynicism, from pride, from cruelty or contempt, ran
on his lips and centred in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the machine? and how to set it working?
Only one way. He crossed to Mariana, laid one
hand upon her head, the other in her hands, and
stooping, kissed her lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then very silently, as some passing from life to
death have done, she, with a sigh that trembled
gently into every limb, swayed back to life. And
on the second breath that stirred her bosom, looked
up, and her eyes came to the face of Mr. Barringcourt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve slept long enough,” said he. “You can’t
complain now of being overworked. A long spell of
rest, and now comes a short one of work. Are you
ready for it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She rose from the chair, no stiffness, the old slow,
easy motion born of coldness; itself born, who could
tell of what.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Six days to finish this—and alone. Can you
accomplish it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For whom?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has she asked for it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She stretched her arms, then drew them in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s well, because I fitted it for her, having no
other model.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are to make it especially beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“It is not necessary to tell me so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And jewels? Everard will bring them to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now she raised her eyebrows slightly and looked
at him, and a faint smile came to her lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is Rosalie then so strong to bear so heavy a
burden of sorrows as this house affords?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Search all you can find from the dust hidden in
this room, and he will bring the rest. Did Rosalie
appear to you so weak?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I loved her on that account I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Part of a cause that changes weakness into
strength. You feel yourself strong, Mariana?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! But cold. The strength of ice, not iron.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie has suffered from your complaint, I think.
But she’s cured.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her eyes rested on his. There was a thoughtful
expression in them, and she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cured? Then the ice was frozen less deeply.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or maybe the fire was stronger. There’s
something in that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said she; then suddenly: “These moths
are a great hindrance. I have no time to spend in
sighs if I must work hard and finish in six days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’ll remove them for six days. After that
they’ll come back again, but you’ll have finished.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. For Rosalie. And when to wear it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“New Year’s Eve.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you. Now you had better leave me.
What of these slippers?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sew them with jewels.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And make her tired feet? Is it some practice of
cruelty?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. A whim of mine. To show honour to an
escaped prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“I must wake. Six days to make a dress, and it is
rumoured that one of the planets was made in that
time! I must hasten.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So then he left her, and she worked alone. And
hour by hour some fresh seam in the design became
completed, and on the third day Everard came. He
carried a large sack, and it was full of jewels of every
known description, small and large. Standing there,
he said suddenly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can I help you with these? Sorting or
stringing?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But surely it’s against the rules.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is advisable to break them in emergency. And
I doubt if this be not finished, some great calamity
will rise. The Master is away. The work is out of
all proportion to the time. For his sake, for yours,
and for hers, I wish to help you, for this day, at
least.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So Mariana gave way, and one little flame of heat
passed over the icy barrier almost unconsciously.
The cell, being less lonely now, lost its ghastliness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus the time passed away until completion, the
last day of the old year, the eve of the new.</p>

<p class='c004'>And on that afternoon at four o’clock Mariana
heaved a sigh of apparent contentment, for all was
now in readiness. And Everard, having done his full
share in the arrangement of jewels, and whatever else
was needed, returned to the door in order to welcome
Mr. Barringcourt, who just then returned.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>To return again for a brief interval to that day
following Christmas Day. Mr. Barringcourt, when
he had left Mariana, went to see the Great High
Priest, and afterwards attended with many others the
Service of Dedication of the Curtain. Miss Crokerly
was there, but not Rosalie. Afterwards Mr. Barringcourt
said to the new High Priest when left alone
together, and the guests departed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why didn’t you invite Miss Paleaf?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have told you why. I am only waiting for
a sufficiently good opportunity to bring forward the
trial.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barringcourt’s lips set. “You make a great
stir about nothing,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t forget the awkward time at which she
spoke.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And when do you propose to send out the
summons?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“On New Year’s Day. A public trial and an
ecclesiastical court.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you as judge?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! There is Golden Priest Ferdinand. I
take no further steps in the matter publicly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the punishment?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Life-time imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Mr. Barringcourt looked at him and laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You laugh? After all, it is worth nothing better.
People must be taught a proper respect for established
religion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In childhood, yes. I doubt when they get older
it’s too late. And so you contemplate lifetime
imprisonment?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Could you suggest anything better?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, there’s escape. What do you say to that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Futile. Absolutely futile.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Devil has helped her once; he may do so
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Devil! Who or what is that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>(They were ignorant of such a person on Lucifram.)</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! I had forgotten. He was never fashionable
here. The Devil is a libel on virtue; the exact
imitator of God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And she is on familiar terms with this—this
atrocity?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I owe a general pardon. I was confounding him
with a Superior Being, an error commoner than one
thinks of.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You speak in riddles,” said the Great High
Priest, and his tone was irritable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean to say God helped her to escape twice
before—nay, three times. You are brave, to say
nothing more of it, to put another spoke in the
wheel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By God do I understand you to mean the
Serpent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As you will. To my certain knowledge she has
kissed the Serpent. The sensation must have been a
new one, almost a dangerous one. After ages spent
hearing the dull praise of men coming from lips all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>stereotyped, one soft kiss would have its—er—its
value.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Great High Priest looked at him sternly, as
became his office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Serpent is above such petty considerations,”
said he. “You speak with too much levity of sacred
things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A fault of my education. Forgive me for it.
And the summons is to be issued on New Year’s
Day?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or on the eve.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I understand you. God and his counterfeit will
help or hinder you. Good-night!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Next morning, walking in the Park, he came on
Rosalie walking with the frog. Quite unconscious
of the impending trial, she stopped on meeting him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning!” said she. “You look very
thoughtful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I’m thinking of taking a very unusual
step.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What, pray?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Paying a visit to my mother,” and he looked at
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That means your father, too, does it not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he answered, still looking at her in the same
thoughtful, absent way. “I frequently visit him.
At present they are separated.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now it was her turn to be thoughtful. “That’s
very sad, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sadder than you’d think of; for, but for the
irony of Fate, they would be quite inseparable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And is it an unusual thing for you to visit her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I do not care to burden her with my
presence, unless there is some reason in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“That sounds unnatural. Does she love you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As much as I love her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That conveys nothing to my mind. Your powers
of love are very enigmatical.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re simple enough on a worthy object.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And she is very worthy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He made no answer, but said presently, with sudden
decision:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mariana has begun upon the dress. It will be
finished on New Year’s Eve.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I to wear it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I went to see her. You guessed at it. But she
seemed more dead than living.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A little extra sleep. She said she needed it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What of the jewel that I lent you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is very safe. I have a request to make to
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish to beg the jewel for my mother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is she like?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Words cannot describe her; to my eyes, the
perfection of beauty and loveliness. As innocent
and simple and free from care or evil as the
light.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t resemble her, do you?” asked Rosalie,
unconscious of the bitterness of her remark.</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed, perceiving it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may rest safely assured there. I know no
one who resembles her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is she kind?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The essence of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then what of Mariana, and such as she?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>His brow clouded. “You ask questions I’m not
disposed to answer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! but I’m thinking of my jewel. I love it so.
Your mother would not value it a tenth part as much
as I. Nay, before to-day it, and others like it, have
been reckoned rubbish. She might think so too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give me leave to take it to her, and await her
verdict. If she underrates it, I’ll bring it back to
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid I must give the dragon so strong a
dose there’ll be no life left in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it is what you told me, the more honour
remains to you in killing it with such a potion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie laughed, but her eyes were
wonderfully serious, and she said simply:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll give it to you, Mr. Barringcourt, because it
seems to me to love one’s mother is the greatest and
the simplest thing in the duty towards one’s neighbour,
if that mother is as she should be. And it is
more than pleasant to me to know that somewhere
in the wide universe there is someone who has broken
through the natural hardness of your heart, and
called forth a respect and love of which I never
thought you capable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The remaining days till New Year’s Eve passed
quickly. The weather was gloriously fine, the
sunsets unequalled.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early in the evening Mariana arrived, and brought
with her a large box containing the dress and other
things. She came in a carriage drawn by chestnut
horses, not occupants of the stables at Marble House.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie came out into the hall to meet her, and
kissed her with affection, which Mariana in her colder
way returned.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Together they went upstairs, Rosalie suddenly
finding herself very short of words to express her
delight at meeting this old friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>And it was Mariana who dressed her completely,
from the arranging of her hair to the tying on of her
clog-shaped, satin-jewelled slippers.</p>

<p class='c004'>And oh! what a dress! With designs of lovers’
knots worked in delicately-tinted jewels all over its
shining surface, and a train that hung from the
shoulders in showers of priceless lace. It was studded
with jewels in the bodice, and on her hair was placed
a tiara that stood high, and had the same design
worked in diamonds. Clasps of gold and jewels
were on her arms, and round her neck one fine
chain of gold—no other ornament.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid, after all, Mariana,” said she at length,
“your great ambition has not come to pass.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What thing was that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You wished it for a wedding-dress.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am content to see it as it is, and you so
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And when to-night is over you will want it
back?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Mariana smiled, half dreamily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night is not yet over, and you will never wish
to part with such a robe. You begged it from the
Master, and you’ll keep it I know none other who
would care to bear so great a load, though in its
beauty all forget to think of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not find it very heavy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Rosalie laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say, Mariana,” said she, “suppose—suppose
when I come to Marble House it should shine red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>all round about me. They’d take me for a veritable
scarlet woman. I have misgivings. I remember
once before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Mariana shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard from the Master you had gained strength
from weakness; and I heard from Everard you had
jewels of your own that you have worn to counteract
the fatal charm of these.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not of my own, Mariana; they were of God.”
“Ah, God! I had forgotten Him. The dream
has passed so long ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God is no dream, but a living reality,
Mariana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was once bitten by a snake, and here they call
the Serpent God. I love not such an image, but
live in the never-ending twilight. I think it is the
shadowed light the idol throws, placing itself betwixt
the world and God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And suddenly Rosalie took her hands in hers, and
drew her to her with a gentle force, and kissed her
lips and forehead, saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“But soon the idol will vanish out of sight, and
the true light come. You needn’t live in the twilight,
Mariana, any more than I. You only need to trust
the Glorious Spirit working behind the leaden cloud,
and struggle silently toward the healing light. And
some day, even though the waiting time be long, the
icy burden will be rolled away, and you all warm
and bright again to love and honour God with
strength unfettered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then Brightcoat said: “I should like to go
with Mariana back to Marble House.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you care for such a companion?” asked
Rosalie of Mariana.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>But the frog jumped across and settled on her
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You need me no more now, Rosalie. I have
done what work I could for you. But now to
Mariana. She may need me as once you did. And
though her heart is cold to-day, the New Year
dawns, and with it in the distance I see a fairer
prospect and a warmer light breaking upon the
horizon of heaven.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so with this new companion Mariana went
away back to the Marble House. Into that gloomy
dwelling, though now all brilliantly lit, the frog
entered unafraid, and none thought to harm it, for
the charm had worked, or perhaps was working.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXV<br /> <span class='large'>THE SUN RISES ON THE YEAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A brilliant house again, a brilliant crowd, the eve
of the New Year, the death-bed of the Old. Just
three hours more to wait.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as Rosalie drove along, it was as if depression
and the highest spirits fought one another for the
mastery.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The effects of wearing fine clothing,” said she,
and laughed and sighed in a breath. “There is
magic in these jewels, I feel certain. Oh! if I could
but wear again my own precious moonstone talisman
against all heaviness, instead of all this finery, that
does its best to cramp my spirits, and half succeeds.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On entering, she was almost immediately joined by
Mr. Barringcourt. Never had he looked to Rosalie
as to-night, never perhaps she to him. With a
scrutiny which had become habitual, they eyed each
other, and at last Rosalie said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you not think I was right in being covetous
of such a lovely gown?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the jewels?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, they were an extra thrown in. I’d much
rather have been without them. You should be
kind, not lavish, Mr. Barringcourt. After an hour’s
wearing they begin to assert their individuality and
weight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And at first you felt them light?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>“Being alive to their beauty, I was dead to their
encumbrance.” And then again, this time seriously,
she said: “But in truth I must acknowledge, perhaps,
their weight cannot be very great, for I have the
greatest wish to dance through every dance, and look
to you to find me partners. I am not really altered
because I stole behind the temple curtain; for one
night it might be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first dance is with me, and the last
one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! I am in a mood of ingratitude to-night.
I cannot for the favour of this dress, and all its
valuable accessories, even say ‘Thank you.’ Find me
a partner for the dance that’s just beginning. No one
has come near me since I came.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first dance is with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed, no. I’m entering on a life of self-denial.
As soon as I want to do a thing I shall cross myself
and do the opposite. What chance shall I stand of
heaven, do you think, at that rate?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll never get there. Be guided by me, and be
less contrary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It goes very much against the grain for me to
dance with you. Must I be consistent, or must I be
contrary?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Become impersonal, and leave the decision with
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are too selfish to be altogether trusted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I? Selfish?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I want to dance, and here you keep
me talking. I want to study men and form
comparisons.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can’t in a place like this. On these occasions
they’re all more or less alike.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>“And on all others. The similarity of humanity is
nerve-destroying.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A very pleasant state of things. None but a fool
would wish it otherwise. But if you wish to dance
you shall have partners in sufficiency. I’ll say you’re
quite harmless to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say no such thing. Mariana tells me she was
once bitten by a snake, and so was I. Since then
I’ve had the greatest inclination to bite everyone who
comes near me. She took it badly; I, by God’s help,
was enabled to take it well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What particular snake was it that bit you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think it must have been the God of
Lucifram.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he left her and went away, and through the
evening Rosalie danced, seemingly happy, on to that
hour when the Old Year and the New meet and part
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she sought Mr. Barringcourt, and found him,
not amongst his guests, but in that now deserted
drawing-room where once Mariana had played for
her. He was looking out on to the gas-lit streets,
and the window being open, the cold night air blew
into the room. The lights in it were shining fully,
yet the city without was plainly visible.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have left the crowd?” said she.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he answered. “They can amuse themselves.
You look tired.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed, an apology for deeper feeling, and
looked at him with eyes whose tiredness was
lost in a certain appeal and pathetic beauty, that
characterised them long since in the days of
silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think I overrated my powers of—of endurance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>I—I should be very pleased to give the last dance to
you. I left it empty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have not danced all evening; I do not wish to
make myself conspicuous now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We could sit it out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We might; but I am contrary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie went up to him and put her hand
very gently in his arm, and almost whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have a feeling of insecurity that grows with
almost every hour. It may be childish, but I never
professed to be much different from a child. When I
stay with you it leaves me more or less, and always
has done from the very first I met you. And now
Brightcoat has left me, and I feel quite alone, a thing
hardly enviable in any sphere. And I’ve gone
through the evening as best I could, and tried to get
the better of my weakness.” And then she laughed
and drew her hand away, and said: “If such
confessions are unusual, you only have this dress
to thank for it. The jewels have magnetic power,
and draw me to the owner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this he turned round from the window and
looked at her, and a very curious smile curved on his
lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s your solution, is it?” he said, and scratched
his head thoughtfully with one finger. Then he
added: “My mother said I was to thank you for the
stone you sent her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was she well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. At the first stroke after midnight I go
again to her. These guests will then have all
departed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>“You say that sadly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The magnetism of the stone I sent her draws me
to your mother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Just then Everard entered the room, carrying in his
hand a large sealed envelope addressed to Rosalie.
At the back it was sealed with the image of the
Serpent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You, Everard?” said Mr. Barringcourt, with some
surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard the door bell ring, and knew it was no
ordinary guest of the evening.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She took and opened it. A summons to appear
before the High Priest’s court, and on the morrow
morning, this first day of the New Year.</p>

<p class='c004'>She read it through, half mystified, the truth with
some difficulty dawning upon her. Then on a sudden
she handed it to Mr. Barringcourt, her face as white
as the background of her dress, and he in his turn
read it. Then he turned to Everard and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who brought this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A priest who, with his companion, waits outside.
I did not let them in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Master and man looked at one another, the same
grim smile half visible upon each face. Then Mr.
Barringcourt took out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wants still twenty minutes till the dance is
ended. It is barely twenty minutes after twelve.
Are they impatient of delay?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not ask them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll go upon the supposition that they’re
patient.” Then turning to Rosalie, he continued:
“There was a time you told me that you scorned to
run away, and never had done. Afterwards, upon
much less occasion, you trusted to the fleetness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>your feet. And now? Are you prepared to meet
the enemy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed, no. Or perhaps I cannot tell. If you
stood for council on my behalf I think I might enjoy
it. For myself, I could never get much farther than
the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A marvellous short journey, with a sudden ending,
but little reckoned upon Lucifram. What think you
of lifetime imprisonment, Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! It is that that frightens me. I never liked
the thought of prison. Must I really go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What plan of escape is there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her brow knitted thoughtfully; then suddenly
clearing, she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take me away with you. Take me to your
mother?”</p>

<p class='c004'>And she looked so very beautiful, with something
so imperious in her manner, yet so sweet, that little
wonder if the Master consented.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a long journey, and a very final one, and,
moreover, my horses are black.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll trust to the rule of contrary where you’re
concerned, and trust you too. Take me where
you will. I have sufficient power given me of my
own to guard against a vital evil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You trust me to a certain point. No farther.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I trust you altogether, but wish to show it is
not quite from weakness I wish to come with
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we’ll go. My mother is hospitable, and so are
others round about her. Some are better known to
you, no doubt, than she. A stranger is a rarity among
them. You will be welcomed.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>“Alas! But who can travel in a dress like this—at
midnight, in the depth of winter? It is so
conspicuous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No dress could be so suitable. Safe-guarded
against wind or snow, and simple in comparison
of those where we are going. Heat or cold,
darkness or light cannot touch it. It was sewn in
the inner darkness, and shines in the inner light.
Come, Rosalie, the time is up. We must away to
see the sun rise on the New Year.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he led her through those great empty rooms
into the fuller ones, where general hilarity preceded
the closing of the dance. But here they never waited.
Across the palm-house to the doors of glass with the
image of the toad and temple so finely and so clearly
worked in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>At one touch they both flew open, and there,
flooded in a tide of light—red—red—and an
accompanying silence. It travelled swiftly, yet
without sound or violence into the rooms of feasting
and of mirth, carrying silence and a vague alarm.
And noting where it came from, the guests instinctively
crowded out towards that curious garden, on
which faced the real front of Marble House.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there, below the terrace steps, upon the wide
carriage drive, stood a chariot of gold, with seats of
crimson velvet, and harnessed to it the six black
steeds, with tossing heads and eyes of fire, strong,
and sleek, and slim.</p>

<p class='c004'>One youth alone stood at the foremost bridle.
And in the midst of all this ruddy glamour shone
the pure whiteness of Rosalie’s robe, with all its
flimsy showers of lace and jewels. And there beside
the carriage step stood Mariana, the frog upon her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>shoulder, and with her Everard, who had preceded
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Rosalie stepped in lightly and gracefully,
and sat down. Mariana bent forward, and with the
grace peculiar to her arranged the spreading train
about her feet. Then looking up, with mutual feeling
each drew an arm round the other’s neck and kissed.
Rosalie whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will follow, Mariana, and we’ll meet again, in
no land of shadows, red or black, but in the sunlight.
And you’ll bring Everard. A little company along
the road is most desirable. But for the present,
good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And then the Master, gathering the long reins in
his hand as he sat down beside her, wrung Everard’s
hand, and seeing Mariana held her hand toward him
too, bent over it and kissed it, by that one act
undoing all the past in which she suffered through
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Master shook the reins. A thousand tingling
stars shook from them upon and round about the
coal-black steeds. One wild bound forward all in
unison, not on a straight road, but up some climbing
steep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie turned round. And laughing, half in fear
and half in happiness, kissed her hand to Brightcoat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye—till—till we meet again!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the Master turned round also, a face very
unlike to hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>His face was dark and shadowy as it ever had been.
The same contemptuous curl lay on his firm lips; a
mocking laughter was in his eyes. His glance fell
upon Marble House, and the guests all drawn towards
the terraces.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>With his free hand he felt in the pocket of the long
coat he wore.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I forgot to leave my New Year’s presents,
Rosalie,” said he, and brought out a large handful
of precious stones, flinging them down to Lucifram.
Then drawing out another, he handed these to
Rosalie, and bade her throw them too.</p>

<p class='c004'>They fell among the crowd, who gathered them
and praised their beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the six black steeds with little apparent effort
climbed up the steep mountain-side, or so it seemed
to be. And gradually the red light disappeared, and
Lucifram along with it, and darkness followed.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now there was nothing but the wind and icy
snow and loneliness—nothing but the path. Nothing
was to be seen on either side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The spirited steeds, wild as ocean foam, flew up
and on the mountain track, the winds moaned after
them with a song as wild, as full of sad complaint, as
if they were embodied spirits of the sighs and tears
of broken hearts.</p>

<p class='c004'>But no feeling of cold came near Rosalie. The
jewelled robes encased her, proof against everything.
And gradually it seemed as if the darkness gave way
to a glimmering of light. At first it was feeble, but
grew in distinctness, steady, and still steadier.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly a ray of brilliant light—light that could
never blind the eyes—shot straight across the path.
Then came another, another, following thick and fast
from every direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Swiftly the coal-black horses changed in the
flooding light to purest white, visions of inexpressible
and perfect beauty. Rosalie’s heart beat faster with
sudden, unexpected joy. She looked up at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Master, her own face transfigured by the light, as
so was his. For all the weariness, all the contempt,
all the dark shadows, had vanished from his features,
and left nothing but what was full of life, of vigour,
and of kindliness. His eyes, still dark and deep,
looked into hers, the first time on the long and
perilous journey, and he said, laughing, as sometimes
of old:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you prefer looking at me to the magnificence
of all this scenery?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But she clasped his arm in both her hands, and
leaned her forehead against his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>And suddenly he brought the horses to a check,
and drawing her still closer, bent his head and kissed
her cheek. Then she looked up with eyes all wet
with tears, and bright with happiness, and drawing
back a little, said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never thought that things would come out this
way. I—I never imagined that black horses could
come out white—nor you become so altered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It all depends upon the journey that I take.
Sometimes I cross upon another rainbow, that leads
us all down hill from Lucifram at almost break-neck
speed. Then neither I nor these, my horses, alter
much. But look, Rosalie, round about you. This
is a scene worth seeing and remembering.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood up, and giving her his hand, helped her
to her feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then she saw that streams of light and rainbow
garlands were flung from a thousand spheres to meet
this central road, itself a giant rainbow crossing from
Lucifram (a tiny speck of gleaming red in the far, far
distance) towards a country quite unsurpassed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>loveliness. And all around, from the different worlds
of light, came scenes of fairyland.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now she saw a towered city folded in night,
the change from day; and here the bright sunshine
of mid-day glinting upon a noble river, with sloping,
tree-clad hills, and meadows smooth and green.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the sun was setting behind a sea of golden
glory, on whose restless surface danced three round
boats inlaid with pearl. And in the boats sat three
maidens of exquisite beauty, attended by the gentle
wind, their servant, who wafted them towards the
distant shore. And as they went they sang a song
that trembled sweetly on the air and reached in the
soft silence to that golden car, ringing tones of
happiness and joy.</p>

<p class='c004'>So on around: a thousand scenes, and all delightful,
delicate yet clear, country and city all in perfection
spread out everywhere. And each sphere was linked
to each with garlands of lights, so that the nimble
spirit crossed on them, a perfect path of beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie looked and breathed a sigh of admiration.
Then her eyes travelled to the path which they were
crossing. The steep part had been passed. There
now remained only a lesser portion, and that sloped
gently down. This remaining part was free from
danger. Pillars of light garlanded with flowers
guarded the sides.</p>

<p class='c004'>The horses, unwearied with the night’s long race,
moved slowly towards this nearing country, over
whose waking sky the bright dawn was spreading
wings of glory, with silver flutings right east to
west. The descent led to a regal city, where
nothing mean or sordid, no toil and tribulation, no
anxious care or killing sorrow, no oppression, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>dark deeds, no foul disease, no hardened priests or
creeds had ever come. But all was God, the essence
of immortal greatness.</p>

<p class='c004'>And to this city came Rosalie, led by him whom
some had called on Lucifram the Master. And being
all tired with the journey, Rosalie fell asleep just as
they were entering the gates.</p>

<p class='c004'>For no traveller from a darker sphere can enter
there unweary. The soft air, too strong for them,
wafts the frail form to tender sleep, that it undergo
the great and immortal change.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sound of laughter and welcome, Heaven’s
truest music of joy, and then for us a silence.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>So ends a little chapter in the life of Lucifram.
A chapter that bore indirectly upon the Serpent, and
helped gradually to its undoing. But that’s another
tale.</p>

<p class='c015'><cite class='bcite'>Rock.</cite>—“A brilliant piece of romance work.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. <span class='sc'>A. T. Quiller-Couch</span> in the <cite class='bcite'>Daily News</cite>.—“A novel of
uncommon merit; a historical novel of a period rarely attempted
by fiction.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Observer.</cite>—“Mr. Ranger-Gull possesses a brilliant imagination,
original thought, and an able pen. His style is clear and forcible,
and some of the passages in this, his latest story, are full of pathos.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Daily Chronicle.</cite>—“Mr. Ranger-Gull deserves the warmest
praise, and willingly do we accord it.... The story he has
provided, with so carefully studied environment, is one that is strong
in human interest, and told with considerable dramatic power.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Daily Express.</cite>—“To dive deep into the chronicles of serfdom
and tell plainly the story of a long-forgotten deed of noble daring
is good work, and thanks are due to Mr. C. Ranger-Gull for his
story, ‘The Serf.’&nbsp;... The story is wonderfully interesting, and
appeals irresistibly to the British temperament.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Saturday Review.</cite>—“Full as it be of grim realism and ghastly
tragedy, it is impossible not to read this book to the bitter end—bitter
enough, in all conscience.... The book is without doubt
a notable one. It is written in the true spirit of the times which it
so eloquently describes.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Truth.</cite>—“A tale of the life and death of a serf who in the old
Norman days struck a blow of vengeance and for freedom. He
pierced his lord with three arrows, one for each ravished daughter,
and one for freedom, and after thrilling adventures expiates his
crime by a death of the most frightful torture. There are so many
powerful dramatic scenes in the story that I should think the
advertised version of it for the stage would be most effective.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Outlook.</cite>—“The age is well suggested in its marring elements of
sordidness and splendour, fierce cruelty and childlike faith; and the
characterisation is strong in many types; brutal lord, drunken priest,
and chivalrous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jongleur</span></i>. The author achieves a convincing study
of twelfth century England, in the mastery of its strongholds, the
misery of its serfs’ hovels, and the sanctuary of Holy Church.”</p>

spirits never flag. The book is brimful of cleverness.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Sketch.</cite>—“The novel is well-constructed and brightly written. The reader

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Daily Telegraph.</cite>—“The book is amusing, with sufficient plot to awaken
the interest, though relying chiefly for its attraction upon its epigrammatic

remarkably witty and sparkling dialogue, which in itself raises the book above
the general average.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Daily Mail.</cite>—“Sprightly wit is the main feature of Mr. Ranger-Gull’s
comedy. It is flippant, jocular, and epigrammatic. Readers who enjoy quips

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Daily News.</cite>—“A smart and up-to-date novel. The book is readable, and
a pleasant companion for a journey. The end, which is pure farce, is wholly
delightful.”</p>

life as one could wish.... Mr. Gull’s wit is always striking, and occasionally
it fastens to its subject with very mordant force. The whole book is admirably
clever, with no pages in it dull, and some so sparkling that they almost hurt the
eye.”</p>

Mr. Turner is successful, and his sketches of men, women, and creeds are,
generally speaking, humorous, shrewd, and suggestive.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Outlook.</cite>—“A purposeful story altogether out of the common ruck. It is both
daring and convincing. The portrait of Frank Lester is surely as coolly relentless
a thing as has been done for a long time.... It is excellently and pitilessly
done:... We would quote some contingent excellencies. The chief, perhaps,
is Mr. Turner’s dash in carrying off an extravagant situation.... His also is
the gift of broad, almost farcical characterisation. And to these must be added
a brisk turn in narrative, of which scarce a page lack shining example.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Observer.</cite>—“A very well-told story; the characters are drawn with much

probably be popular.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Illustrated London News.</cite>—“One reads with unflagging interest. The great
merit lies in the very cool and effective demonstration of character, and especially
of character that is off conventional lines. The psychology, perhaps, is not very
deep, but, in the plane on which it works, is remarkably given. We have
thoroughly enjoyed ‘The Steeple.’”</p>

novels we have lately had the good fortune to come across. The religious and

it neither irritates nor bores, while its latter-day actuality gives the zest of real

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Speaker.</cite>—“Mr. Turner has shown before that he has a pleasing and unusual
vein of satire. In ‘The Steeple’ he turns his attention to the worldly and successful

some good counterfoils to them.... It is sane and amusing, a most welcome

Mr. Turner’s style is bright, shrewd, and trenchant.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite>—“A cleverly-written story of more than usual interest.
Mr. Turner has here something to say, and says it well. From the first page
onward we follow the career of Maurice Yorke with close interest, an interest
which never flags, and the final chapter is in every way equal to the book’s earlier
promise. There is nothing slipshod, no falling off. The author has given us
sterling good work throughout. The characterisation of Lady Sothern is
excellent—so human withal. ‘The Comedy of Progress’ is a brilliant novel, its
title, by the way, fitting it ‘like a glove.’”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Glasgow Evening Times.</cite>—“Mr. Reginald Turner has achieved another
success in ‘The Comedy of Progress.’ It is a clever novel, pleasantly satirical,
bright in style, and with skilfully sustained interest in the fanciful social and
political personages who figure in its pages.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Morning Post.</cite>—“Readers will be delighted with the ‘Comedy of Progress’
by Reginald Turner. The story is told with skill and true artistic effect. Lady
Sothern is an excellently drawn character, full of life and force. The charm and
influence which she exercises over all who know her are quite convincingly
expressed, and the scene with her husband when she confesses herself an old
woman and stamps on her jewels is very ably done. Mr. Turner may be
sincerely congratulated on accomplishing a difficult task with more restraint and
ability than one generally expects in such efforts.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Spectator.</cite>—“Problems and politics are dealt with in ‘The Comedy of
Progress,’ and both are to a certain extent successfully treated. The story is
readable, and the pictures of society are not badly drawn.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Daily Telegraph.</cite>—“Mr. Turner has a pretty knack of touching off a character,
or expressing a quaint thought, in a couple of lines, and there is no blinking the
fact that some of his portraits are diverting likenesses of people he had met in
the flesh.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>St. James’s Gazette.</cite>—“The book is decidedly clever. Maurice Yorke himself,
Lord and Lady Sothern, and Jonas Allen, are distinct and well-drawn characters,
conceived and maintained with considerable skill. The story is something more
than a political novel. It is concerned with the philosophy of life and its aims.
There is much serious thought and practical wisdom in its pages, set forth in
dialogue, which is always amusing and sometimes brilliant.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>Athenæum.</cite>—“‘The Comedy of Progress’ contains clever conversation and
well-realised characters.”</p>

<p class='c016'><cite class='bcite'>The County Gentleman.</cite>—“Mr. Turner is evidently an exceedingly close
observer of men and matters, and in addition he has a considerable power of
analysis of emotions and impulses of the springs which move to action and the
restraining forces which control men’s natural desires and ambitions....
‘The Comedy of Progress’ is throughout wittily and well written, and ought to
interest those who like a serious subject carefully treated, and with more than an
occasional passage of pure fun and humour.”</p>

affair. It was supposed that he was an innocent man, the victim of a
fatal resemblance to a scoundrel named Dubosc. His case has been
used by hundreds of barristers to bolster up a defence based on the
theory of mistaken identity. This book demolishes the theory of his
innocence. It is written by a descendant of one of the victims, who
proves that Lesurques was guilty, that his sufferings were no more than
he merited, and that if he went to the guillotine dressed in white, the
garb of innocence, this was only a final piece of duplicity on his part.
A true story of the “good old times” in France after the Revolution,
with dramatic pictures of the unequal struggle between the police and
the army of scoundrels. In illustration of the state of things in the
Year IV. (1796) an account is given of the doings of a certain Bondroux,
who was the Dick Turpin of the Lyons highroad.</p>

<p class='c016'>Few chapters in fiction are more striking than the true account of
the arrest of Joseph Lesurques at the Assize Court in Paris, during
the trial of his accomplices; a fresh illustration of the resistless force
or fascination of danger which draws criminals on by the most imprudent
acts to their destruction.</p>

<p class='c016'>It exposes in its true light the character of the famous Conventionnel,
Merlin de Douai, who inspired Victor Hugo with one of his noblest
creations, and suggests the reflection that if one knew the truth many
names which have come down to posterity with immaculate reputations
would stand in a different place in the public esteem.</p>

<p class='c016'>In view of recent efforts in France to bring about the revision of a
celebrated case, the various unsuccessful attempts of the Lesurques
family to have the judgment passed on their ancestor quashed will be
read with interest. They show the inviolability of the “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chose jugée</span>.</i>”</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
